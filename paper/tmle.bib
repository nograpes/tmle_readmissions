The data indicate that reductions in length of stay are offset by the rising number of admissions. An examination of multiple stays--a major factor in the number of discharges--shows that States with high rates of discharges have high percentages of patients with multiple stays. Furthermore, in these States the percentage of multiple stays is high, no matter what the diagnosis. In other States, the rate is low for all diagnoses. These findings suggest that options exist for the provision of care for the same or similar conditions and that geographic patterns appear in the use of those options.

Predicting hospital readmission risk is of great interest to identify which patients would benefit most from care transition interventions, as well as to risk-adjust readmission rates for the purposes of hospital comparison.


{OBJECTIVE}

To summarize validated readmission risk prediction models, describe their performance, and assess suitability for clinical or administrative use.


{DATA} {SOURCES} {AND} {STUDY} {SELECTION}

The databases of {MEDLINE}, {CINAHL}, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception through March 2011, the {EMBASE} database was searched through August 2011, and hand searches were performed of the retrieved reference lists. Dual review was conducted to identify studies published in the English language of prediction models tested with medical patients in both derivation and validation cohorts.


{DATA} {EXTRACTION}

Data were extracted on the population, setting, sample size, follow-up interval, readmission rate, model discrimination and calibration, type of data used, and timing of data collection.


{DATA} {SYNTHESIS}

Of 7843 citations reviewed, 30 studies of 26 unique models met the inclusion criteria. The most common outcome used was 30-day readmission; only 1 model specifically addressed preventable readmissions. Fourteen models that relied on retrospective administrative data could be potentially used to risk-adjust readmission rates for hospital comparison; of these, 9 were tested in large {US} populations and had poor discriminative ability (c statistic range: 0.55-0.65). Seven models could potentially be used to identify high-risk patients for intervention early during a hospitalization (c statistic range: 0.56-0.72), and 5 could be used at hospital discharge (c statistic range: 0.68-0.83). Six studies compared different models in the same population and 2 of these found that functional and social variables improved model discrimination. Although most models incorporated variables for medical comorbidity and use of prior medical services, few examined variables associated with overall health and function, illness severity, or social determinants of health.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Most current readmission risk prediction models that were designed for either comparative or clinical purposes perform poorly. Although in certain settings such models may prove useful, efforts to improve their performance are needed as use becomes more widespread.},

	abstract = {In order to examine the proportion of Medicare expenditures attributable to repeated admissions to the hospital, we assessed the frequency with which 270,266 randomly selected Medicare beneficiaries were readmitted after hospital discharge between 1974 and 1977. Twenty-two per cent of Medicare hospitalizations were followed by a readmission within 60 days of discharge. Medicare spent over \$2.5 billion per year (24 per cent of Medicare inpatient expenditures) on such readmissions between 1974 and 1977. Analogous expenditures in 1984 could approach \$8 billion. Even a small decrease in the readmission rate could result in substantial savings for the Medicare program. The recently enacted prospective-payment legislation, however, creates economic incentives that could increase readmission rates. Attempts by professional review organizations or others to develop hospital readmission profiles will need to control for patient and hospital characteristics that are correlated with the likelihood of readmission. Further study of such characteristics could help identify high-risk patient groups for whom increased outpatient supports might prove cost effective.},

Anderson calculates cost at a very basic level, and gives the probability of readmission by single variable. Not even a logistic regression.
The reaction appears in the discussion. He quotes the health care financing administration ({HFCA}) (this later became the {CMS}) to say that we could reduce costs by 2\% if we reduced 60d readmits by 10\%. He also says that the prospective-payment system may cause physicians to "unbundle" admissions.}

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To measure the re-admission rate and the number of preventable re-admissions in a secondary-level South African hospital, and to identify factors predictive of re-admission.
{METHOD}: The admission register for the medical wards at Cecilia Makiwane Hospital ({CMH}) was used to identify re-admitted patients, whose folders were then reviewed. A comparison group of patients who were not re-admitted was randomly generated from the same register.
{RESULTS}: The re-admission rate for the 7 months ending October 2006 was 8.5\% (262/3 083). Patients who were more likely to be re-admitted had chronic respiratory disease (odds ratio ({OR}) 4.2, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 1.2 - 14.6), {HIV} infection ({OR} 5.0, {CI} 2.1 - 12.0), were older than 50 years ({OR} 5.2, {CI} 2.5 - 10.9), had a first admission of more than 8 days ({OR} 3.2, {CI} 1.5 - 6.6) or a booked medical outpatients followup ({OR} 5.1, {CI} 2.6 - 10.3). Age distribution of re-admissions was bimodal, with {HIV}-positive individuals (27.4\% overall) accounting for 50\% of all admissions younger than 50 years, but only 9.1\% of those 50 years or older. In individuals older than 50 years, 42.1\% of admissions were due to chronic cardiorespiratory illnesses. Half of re-admissions were judged to be potentially preventable, mainly through improved patient education.
{CONCLUSION}: One in 12 general medical patients was readmitted. Chronic diseases and inadequate patient education and discharge planning accounted for the largest group of re-admissions in older patients. Re-admission of {HIV}/{AIDS} patients has generated a second peak in younger individuals, and the impact of the antiretroviral roll-out on admission rates warrants further scrutiny.},
