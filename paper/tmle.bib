	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Little is known about the factors that predispose children with congenital heart disease ({CHD)} to readmission soon after hospital discharge. We sought to determine rates and risk factors for hospital readmission within 1 month among children with {CHD.}


{METHODS}

Data were obtained from administrative databases that record all hospitalizations within the province of Quebec. We included children 0 to 17 years with {CHD} who were hospitalized with a cardiac diagnosis (an "index hospitalization") between 1990 and 2005. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to identify predictors of readmission.


{RESULTS}

Among 3675 hospitalizations, there were 518 readmissions (15\%) within 31 days. Median time to readmission was 12 days (interquartile range 5-19 days). Readmissions occurred in the same hospital as the index hospitalization 86\% of the time. The most common diagnoses at readmission were cardiac (59\%) and respiratory illnesses (12\%). Independent predictors of readmission were severe {CHD} lesion, younger age, Friday or Saturday discharge, having an emergency department visit within the preceding 6 months, length of index hospitalization {\textgreater} 14 days, and multiple ({\textgreater} or = 4) diagnoses (either cardiac diagnoses or comorbid conditions). Having an invasive procedure during the index hospitalization reduced the likelihood of readmission.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Readmission occurred after 1 in 7 hospitalizations. Infants and patients with severe {CHD} lesions were among those more likely to be readmitted. The risk of readmission may be reduced by avoiding hospital discharge at the beginning of a weekend. Further studies are needed to determine if targeted interventions will reduce readmission rates in high-risk patients.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

To determine whether the quality of care during a hospital stay is associated with unplanned readmission within 14 days.


{DESIGN}

Case-control study.


{SETTING}

12 Veterans Affairs hospitals.


{PATIENTS}

Men discharged after a hospitalization for diabetes (n = 593), chronic obstructive lung disease (n = 1172), or heart failure (n = 748). The ratio of controls (men without an unplanned readmission within 14 days to any Veterans Affairs hospital) to cases (men with such a readmission) was 3:1.


{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}

Unplanned readmission to any of the 159 Veterans Affairs hospitals within 14 days of discharge. Quality of care during the index stay was assessed by chart review using disease-specific explicit criteria for the process of inpatient care, which were developed by panels composed of expert physicians. Adherence scores (the percentage of applicable criteria that were met) were calculated for the admission workup, evaluation and treatment, and readiness for discharge.


{RESULTS}

After adjustment was made for demographic characteristics, severity of illness, and need for care, adherence scores correlated with early unplanned readmission (P {\textless} 0.05). For patients with diabetes and heart failure, decreased readiness-for-discharge adherence scores correlated with increased risk for readmission (P = 0.001 and P = 0.016, respectively). In patients with obstructive lung disease, decreased admission-workup scores correlated with increased risk for readmission (P = 0.013). One of 7 readmissions in patients with diabetes, 1 of 5 readmissions in patients with heart failure, and 1 of 12 readmissions in patients with obstructive lung disease were attributable to substandard care.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Lower quality of inpatient care increases the risk for unplanned early readmission in patients with heart failure, diabetes, or obstructive lung disease. Under certain circumstances, readmission is associated with remediable deficiencies in the process of inpatient care.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16776457},
	abstract = {{SETTING}

During 2002-2003, a large outbreak of tuberculosis ({TB)} occurred among persons using multiple homeless facilities in King County, Washington.


{OBJECTIVE}

To control the transmission of {TB} in multiple settings.


{DESIGN}

In 2002, contacts exposed to patients in homeless facilities were screened using tuberculin skin tests ({TSTs)} and symptom review. Based on these screening results, sites of transmission were identified and prioritised, and exposed cohorts at these sites were offered intensive screening tests in 2003 (e.g., symptom review, {TST}, chest radiograph [{CXR]}, sputum examination and culture). Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from patients were genotyped using {PCR-based} methods to identify outbreak-associated patients quickly.


{RESULTS}

During 2002-2003, 48 (15\%) of 313 patients diagnosed in King County were outbreak-associated; 47 culture-positive patients had isolates that matched the outbreak strain by genotyping. Three facilities visited by {\textgreater}12 patients in 2002 had a higher prevalence of {TST} positive results (approximately 30\%) among clients compared with the background rate (7\%) in the homeless community. Screening contacts with one sputum culture was as sensitive as {CXR} in detecting {TB} disease (77\% vs. 62\%, respectively).


{CONCLUSIONS}

A comprehensive, resource-intensive approach likely helped to control transmission. This outbreak highlights the vulnerability of homeless populations and the need to maintain robust {TB} programs in urban settings.},

	abstract = {The National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System ({NNIS)} is an ongoing collaborative surveillance system sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control ({CDC)} to obtain national data on nosocomial infections. The {CDC} uses the data that are reported voluntarily by participating hospitals to estimate the magnitude of the nosocomial infection problem in the United States and to monitor trends in infections and risk factors. Hospitals collect data by prospectively monitoring specific groups of patients for infections with the use of protocols called surveillance components. The surveillance components used by the {NNIS} are hospitalwide, intensive care unit, high-risk nursery, and surgical patient. Detailed information including demographic characteristics, infections and related risk factors, pathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibilities, and outcome, is collected on each infected patient. Data on risk factors in the population of patients being monitored are also collected; these permit the calculation of risk-specific rates. An infection risk index, which includes the traditional wound class, is being evaluated as a predictor of the likelihood that an infection will develop after an operation. A major goal of the {NNIS} is to use surveillance data to develop and evaluate strategies to prevent and control nosocomial infections. The data collected with the use of the surveillance components permit the calculation of risk-specific infection rates, which can be used by individual hospitals as well as national health-care planners to set priorities for their infection control programs and to evaluate the effectiveness of their efforts. The {NNIS} will continue to evolve in finding more effective and efficient ways to assess the influence of patient risk and changes in the financing of health care on the infection rate.},

In Canada, tuberculosis ({TB)} is increasingly an urban health problem. Montreal is Canada's second-largest city and the second most frequent destination for new immigrants and refugees.


{OBJECTIVES}

To detect spatial aggregation of cases, areas of excess incidence and local 'hot spots' of transmission in Montreal.


{DESIGN}

We used residential addresses to geocode active {TB} cases reported on the Island of Montreal in 1996-2000. After a hot spot analysis suggested two areas of overconcentration, we conducted a spatial scan, with census tracts (population 2500-8000) as the primary unit of analysis and stratification by birthplace. We linked these analyses with genotyping of all available Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, using {IS6110-RFLP} and spoligotyping.


{RESULTS}

We identified four areas of excess incidence among the foreign-born (incidence rate ratios 1.3-4.1, relative to the entire Island) and one such area among the Canadian-born (incidence rate ratio 2.3). There was partial overlap with the two hot spots. Genotyping indicated ongoing transmission among the foreign-born within the largest high-incidence zone. While this zone overlapped the area of high incidence among Canadian-born, genotyping largely excluded transmission between the two groups.


{CONCLUSIONS}

In a city with low overall incidence, spatial and molecular analyses highlighted ongoing local transmission.},

Patient data that includes precise locations can reveal patients' identities, whereas data aggregated into administrative regions may preserve privacy and confidentiality. We investigated the effect of varying degrees of address precision (exact latitude and longitude vs the center points of zip code or census tracts) on detection of spatial clusters of cases.


{METHODS}

We simulated disease outbreaks by adding supplementary spatially clustered emergency department visits to authentic hospital emergency department syndromic surveillance data. We identified clusters with a spatial scan statistic and evaluated detection rate and accuracy.


{RESULTS}

More clusters were identified, and clusters were more accurately detected, when exact locations were used. That is, these clusters contained at least half of the simulated points and involved few additional emergency department visits. These results were especially apparent when the synthetic clustered points crossed administrative boundaries and fell into multiple zip code or census tracts.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The spatial cluster detection algorithm performed better when addresses were analyzed as exact locations than when they were analyzed as center points of zip code or census tracts, particularly when the clustered points crossed administrative boundaries. Use of precise addresses offers improved performance, but this practice must be weighed against privacy concerns in the establishment of public health data exchange policies.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

We examined the usefulness of a simple method to account for incomplete postdischarge follow-up during surveillance of surgical site infection ({SSI)} by use of the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance ({NNIS)} system's risk index.


{DESIGN}

Retrospective cohort study that used data prospectively collected from 1993 through 2006.


{SETTING}

Five private, nonuniversity healthcare facilities in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.


{PATIENTS}

Consecutive patients undergoing the following {NNIS} operative procedures: 20,981 operations on the genitourinary system, 11,930 abdominal hysterectomies, 7,696 herniorraphies, 6,002 cholecystectomies, and 6,892 laparotomies.


{METHODS}

For each operative procedure category, 2 {SSI} risk models were specified. First, a model based on the {NNIS} system's risk index variables was specified (hereafter referred to as the {NNIS-based} model). Second, a modified model (hereafter referred to as the modified {NNIS-based} model), which was also based on the {NNIS} system's risk index, was specified with a postdischarge surveillance indicator, which was assigned the value of 1 if the patient could be reached during follow-up and a value of 0 if the patient could not be reached. A formal comparison of the capabilities of the 2 models to assess the risk of {SSI} was conducted using measures of calibration (by use of the Pearson goodness-of-fit test) and discrimination (by use of receiver operating characteristic curves). Goodman-Kruskal correlations (G) were also calculated.


{RESULTS}

The rate of incomplete postdischarge follow-up varied between 29.8\% for abdominal hysterectomies and 50.5\% for cholecystectomies. The modified {NNIS-based} model for laparotomy did not show any significant benefit over the {NNIS-based} model in any measure. For all other operative procedures, the modified {NNIS-based} model showed a significantly improved discriminatory ability and higher G statistics, compared with the {NNIS-based} model, with no significant impairment in calibration, except if used to assess the risk of {SSI} after operations on the genitourinary system or after a cholecystectomy.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Compared with the {NNIS-based} model, the modified {NNIS-based} model added potentially useful clinical information regarding most of the operative procedures. Further work is warranted to evaluate this method for accounting for incomplete postdischarge follow-up during surveillance of {SSI.}},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

To determine if the delivery of hospital discharge summaries to follow-up physicians decreases the risk of hospital readmission.


{SUBJECTS}

Eight hundred eighty-eight patients discharged from a single hospital following treatment for an acute medical illness.


{SETTING}

Teaching hospital in a universal health-care system.


{DESIGN}

We determined the date that each patient's discharge summary was printed and the physicians to whom it was sent. Summary receipt was confirmed by survey and phoning each physician's office. Each patient's hospital chart was reviewed to determine their acute and chronic medical conditions as well as their course in hospital. Using population-based administrative databases, all post-hospitalization visits were identified. For each of these visits, we determined whether the summary was available.


{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}

Time to nonelective hospital readmission during 3 months following discharge.


{RESULTS}

The discharge summary was available for only 568 of 4,639 outpatient visits (12.2\%). Overall, 240 (27.0\%) of patients were urgently readmitted to hospital. After adjusting for significant patient and hospitalization factors, we found a trend toward a decreased risk of readmission for patients who were seen in follow-up by a physician who had received a summary (relative risk 0.74, 95\% confidence interval 0.50 to 1.11).


{CONCLUSIONS}

The risk of rehospitalization may decrease when patients are assessed following discharge by physicians who have received the discharge summary. Further research is required to determine if better continuity of patient information improves patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {Admission Medication Reconciliation (Med Rec) is an organizational practice designed to ensure patients' pre-admission medications are ordered correctly upon hospital admission. We describe the implementation of admission Med Rec at two academic health sciences centres, each having designed distinctly different processes. Common challenges encountered included the multi-step, inter-professional nature of Med Rec, staffing resource and workload concerns and frequent medical staff turnover in a teaching environment. Both teams found that participation in a national safety collaborative enabled the pilot initially; however, they later found the outcome measures suggested by the collaborative less useful and switched to internal compliance measures for establishing maintenance and spread. Common themes were identified among the critical success factors, with unique variations at each centre. Both teams acknowledged accreditation standards to be a major accelerator of implementation and spread. Using different measures of implementation success at each centre, the majority of patient admissions on the pilot units are complying with admission Med Rec. However, very high levels of compliance remain elusive. At Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre's pilot unit, 62-77\% of patients are being screened by a pharmacist and 65-75\% of high-risk patients identified are undergoing Med Rec by a pharmacist. At The Hospital for Sick Children's pilot unit, 72-88\% of patients have a physician's primary medication history documented on a Med Rec form and 57-73\% of patients are also undergoing Med Rec by a nurse or pharmacist.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Prior studies suggest that unintended medication discrepancies that represent errors are common at the time of hospital admission. These errors are particularly worthy of attention because they are not likely to be detected by computerized physician order entry systems.


{METHODS}

We prospectively studied patients reporting the use of at least 4 regular prescription medications who were admitted to general internal medicine clinical teaching units. The primary outcome was unintended discrepancies (errors) between the physicians' admission medication orders and a comprehensive medication history obtained through interview. We also evaluated the potential seriousness of these discrepancies. All discrepancies were reviewed with the medical team to determine if they were intentional or unintentional. All unintended discrepancies were rated for their potential to cause patient harm.


{RESULTS}

After screening 523 admissions, 151 patients were enrolled based on the inclusion criteria. Eighty-one patients (53.6\%; 95\% confidence interval, 45.7\%-61.6\%) had at least 1 unintended discrepancy. The most common error (46.4\%) was omission of a regularly used medication. Most (61.4\%) of the discrepancies were judged to have no potential to cause serious harm. However, 38.6\% of the discrepancies had the potential to cause moderate to severe discomfort or clinical deterioration.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Medication errors at the time of hospital admission are common, and some have the potential to cause harm. Better methods of ensuring an accurate medication history at the time of hospital admission are needed.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Medication reconciliation is recognized as important, but no one method has been recommended. Research has shown that the most common medication reconciliation errors are attributable to omitted medications and doses. The pharmacy claims aggregator used in this evaluation is a private company that gathers pharmacy claims data from disparate pharmacy benefit managers into a secure repository (hereafter referred to as the claims database) under contracts with public and private health plans. A web interface for the repository can be used by subscribing health systems and health care providers to view patient-level pharmacy claims data to support patient care. At the time of this study, the claims database contained information from 5 public and private health insurance programs covering approximately 500,000 enrollees in Arizona.


{OBJECTIVE}

To compare current medication lists (medication name and strength) collected by patient interview upon admission at a medical center with those collected by a company that aggregates pharmacy claims data.


{METHODS}

This study was a retrospective chart review. A list of 300 patients was produced by a medical center using random number generation for patients who were (a) admitted to the medical center from January 1, 2007, through June 30, 2007; (b) aged 18 years or older; and (c) enrollees of health plans that send pharmacy claims data to the claims database. The first 100 patients on this list who were found in the claims database were included in the study sample. Patient-reported current medication information recorded on the medical center's admission medication reconciliation form was compared with the current medication information in the claims database at the time of admission. Medications, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter ({OTC)} products, supplements, and herbals, were considered current in the medication reconciliation form based on patient reports of medications still being taken upon admission to the medical center. Medications were considered current in the claims database if the most recent fill date plus days supply was equal to or greater than the hospital admission date. Data were collected by an investigator on a standardized data collection form designed for this evaluation. The investigator gathered information from the medical center for each study patient and then queried each patient in the claims database to record data. These 2 medication lists were matched, and discrepancies were noted both at the patient-drug level and at the patient level. Rates of omissions and discrepancies were calculated for each information source, and the {McNemar} chi-square test for binomial proportions in matched-pair data was used to assess the statistical significance of differences between information sources.


{RESULTS}

Of the 100 patients, a total of 78 patients had medication reconciliation records in their medical center charts that could be compared with claims data. A total of 280 medications were listed for these 78 patients, with 196 medications recorded in the claims database and 131 recorded on the medication reconciliation form. At the patient-drug level, significantly more medications and strengths were listed in the claims database than in the medication reconciliation form (medications: 70.0\% of 280 vs. 46.8\% of 280, respectively; strengths: 100.0\% of 196 vs. 71.8\% of 131, respectively; both comparisons P {\textless} 0.001). One-half of the medications omitted in the claims database (42 of 84) were {OTC} medications. On a patient level, there was no significant between-source difference in the proportion of patients who had at least 1 missing medication (44.9\% claims vs. 52.6\% medication reconciliation form, P = 0.337), but there was a significant difference in the proportion of patients for whom at least 1 strength was missing (0.0\% claims vs. 23.1\% medication reconciliation form, P {\textless} 0.001). All medications and strengths matched in 24 of 78 (30.8\%) patients.


{CONCLUSION}

Information collected using a claims database produced a more complete list of medication names and strengths than that compiled upon admission interviews at the medical center. However, the claims database did not contain information about medications that were not reimbursed by insurance. The most accurate method of obtaining the complete medication list may be to combine these 2 techniques.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate factors that influence hospital readmissions of elderly patients and to construct a robust hospital readmissions predictive model.
Design: Each hospitalised patient was interviewed and medical, demographic and socioeconomic data were obtained from their medical charts. These patients were followed up prospectively for 1 year post discharge with all unplanned readmissions to general medical (including cardiology) wards during this time period recorded. Univariate analysis (chi-squared) was used to identify variables that had at least a minimal association with one or more unplanned readmissions 12 months post discharge (p {\textless} 0.25). These were entered into backward stepwise elimination logistic regression analysis (model entry set at p = 0.05). Examination of the significance of the log-likelihood ratio test for each variable determined its contribution to the model.
Patients: Data from a total of 487 elderly patients ({\textgreater}=65 years of age) with non-elective admissions to general medicine wards were used to refine the re- admissions model. The refined model was then validated using similar data retrospectively collected from medical charts regarding 732 elderly patients ({\textgreater}=65 years of age).
Results: Multivariate logistic regression analysis yielded a nine-variable model, which contained both predictive and protective variables for one or more readmissions 12 months post discharge from hospital. This model had a specificity of 79.3\%, sensitivity of 60.0\% and overall accuracy of 71.2\% (cut-off point of p = 0.5). When the model was applied to the validation population, an overall percentage accuracy in classification of 65.2\% was obtained.
Conclusions: This refined and validated hospital readmissions predictive model could be used by healthcare professionals to help identify vulnerable patients upon admission to hospital, and to put in place a comprehensive discharge planning process.

	abstract = {The lifetime risk of developing disease, the incubation period, and the time period between infection and transmission (the serial interval) are three important measures for interpreting trends in tuberculous infection and disease but are complicated by strong age dependencies regarding disease risk and by the potential for reinfection to occur. By using a model of the epidemiology of tuberculosis in England and Wales, the authors demonstrated that all three measures changed dramatically during the 20th century largely as a result of declines in the risk of infection. The estimated lifetime risk was highest following infection in early adulthood and declined with year of infection; the age-weighted average was approximately 12\% during the last 50 years. Incubation period distributions depend on whether they are viewed prospectively (from infection to disease onset) or retrospectively (since infection for cases with disease onset at a particular time). As children rarely develop infectious forms of tuberculosis, infections acquired in childhood are associated with considerably longer serial intervals than those acquired in adulthood. These unusual properties are probably shared by other infections with long intervals between infection and disease. The results are important for interpreting data on transmission patterns, as are now being derived from molecular epidemiologic studies.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

We sought to determine the degree and possible causes of variability in admission practices among individual emergency physicians ({EPs)} at 1 emergency department ({ED)} using a Canadian Emergency Department Triage Acuity Scale ({CTAS)-matched} {ED} patient population.


{METHODS}

We distributed a survey measuring attitudes and demographics to all {EPs} (n = 30) at a large regional hospital. Hospital admissions data from 1 calendar year were matched to individual {EP} survey results. Emergency physicians were ranked as "lower," "average" or "higher" admitters and, using these categorical variables, the data set was analyzed for correlations and trends.


{RESULTS}

Overall, 97.0\% of the {EPs} responded to the survey. Admissions by {EPs} ranged from 8.7\% to 17.0\%, (mean 12.52, standard deviation [{SD]} 2.21) of all patients seen. {CTAS} category-specific admission data demonstrated variability in the admission ranking of individual {EPs.} No {EPs} consistently performed at any 1 admission ranking across all {CTAS} categories. More years of emergency medicine experience was significantly correlated with higher admissions in the {CTAS-2} ranking (r = 0.4, p {\textless} 0.05). Whether a physician worked full-time, part-time or as a locum was not associated with patterns of admission, nor was any particular postgraduate certification (e.g., {CCFP}, {CCFP} {EM}, {FRCPC)} or any of the surveyed attitudinal traits.


{CONCLUSION}

Individual {EPs'} overall and {CTAS-specific} admissions varied substantially, and followed an approximately normal distribution curve. Emergency physicians with more years of experience had a statistically higher {CTAS-2} admission rate; however, other variables, including postgraduate certification status, decision-related attitudes toward admission, and reported practices were not associated with admission proportions. Emergency physicians tend to have uniquely individual admission ranking profiles across all the {CTAS} categories.},

	abstract = {Since the anthrax attacks of October 2001 and the {SARS} outbreaks of recent years, there has been an increasing interest in developing surveillance systems to aid in the early detection of such illness. Systems have been established which do this is by monitoring primary health-care visits, pharmacy sales, absenteeism records, and other non-traditional sources of data. While many resources have been invested in establishing such systems, relatively little effort has as yet been expended in evaluating their performance. One way to evaluate a given surveillance system is to compare the signals it generates with known outbreaks identified in other systems. In public health practice, for example, public health departments investigate reports of illness and sometimes track hospital admissions. Comparison of new systems with extant systems cannot generate estimates of test characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity, since the actual number of positives and negatives cannot be known. However, the comparison can reveal whether a new or proposed system's signals match outbreaks detected by the existing system. This could help support or reject the new system as an alternative or complement to the extant system. We propose three methods to test the null hypothesis that the new system does not signal true outbreaks more often than would be expected by chance. The methods differ in the restrictiveness of the assumptions required. Each test may detect weaknesses in the new system, depending on the distribution of outbreaks and can be used to construct confidence limits on the agreement between the new system's signals and the outbreaks, given the distribution of the signals. They can be used to assess whether the new system works in that it detects the outbreaks better than chance would suggest and can also determine if the new systems' signals are generated earlier than an extant system.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

To examine the possible use of readmission rates as an outcome indicator of hospital inpatient care by investigating avoidability of unplanned readmissions within 28 days of discharge.


{DESIGN}

Retrospective analysis of a stratified random sample of case notes of patients with an unplanned readmission between July 1987 and June 1988 by nine clinical assessors (263 assessments) and categorisation of the readmission as avoidable, unavoidable, or unclassifiable.


{SETTING}

District in North East Thames region. 481 General medical, geriatric, and general surgical inpatients with a readmission at 0-6 days or 21-27 days after the first (index) discharge between July 1987 and June 1988 from whom 100 case notes were selected randomly and of which 74 were available for study.


{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}

Assessment of readmissions as avoidable, unavoidable, unclassifiable, variability of assessment within cases and variability among assessors according to specialty and duration to readmission.


{RESULTS}

General medical and geriatric readmissions and surgical readmissions at 0-6 days after discharge were more likely to be assessed as avoidable than those at 21-27 days (medical readmissions 32 v 6\%, surgical admissions 49 v 19\%). General surgical readmissions were significantly more frequently assessed as avoidable than general medical and geriatric readmissions. The extent of agreement between doctors varied, with general medical and geriatric readmissions at 21-27 days after first discharge causing the greatest variability of judgment.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Differences were apparent in the extent of avoidability of readmissions in different groups of admissions. However, assessors rated only 49.3\% of the group with the highest proportion of avoidable admissions (surgical readmissions at 0-6 days) as avoidable.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

To define a set of screening criteria that identifies elders who are at high risk for repeated hospital admission in the future.


{DESIGN}

Longitudinal cohort study. Logistic regression analysis of data from half of the subjects was used to identify risk factors for repeated hospital admission. The ability of these risk factors to identify elders who are at high risk for repeated hospitalization in the future was then tested using data from the other half of the subjects.


{SETTING}

United States.


{PARTICIPANTS}

A subsample (n = 5876) of a multistage probability sample of all non-institutionalized {U.S.} civilians who were 70 years or older in 1984.


{MEASUREMENTS}

At baseline (1984), elderly subjects were asked about their demographic, socioeconomic, medical, and functional characteristics and about their recent use of health services. Their subsequent hospital admissions and mortality were then monitored through the records of the Medicare program and the National Death Index (1985-88).


{RESULTS}

Among the subjects in the first half of the sample, eight factors emerged as risk factors for repeated admission: older age, male sex, poor self-rated general health, availability of an informal caregiver, having ever had coronary artery disease, and having had, during the previous year, a hospital admission, more than six doctor visits, or diabetes. Based on the presence or absence of these factors in 1984, 7.2\% of the subjects in the second half of the sample were estimated to have a high probability of repeated admission (Pra {\textgreater} or = 0.5) during 1985-1988. In comparison with subjects estimated to have a low risk (Pra {\textless} 0.5), this high-risk group's actual experiences during 1985-1988 included a higher cumulative incidence of repeated admission (41.8\% vs 26.2\%, P {\textless} 0.0001), a higher cumulative rate of mortality (44.2\% vs 19.0\%, P {\textless} 0.0001), more hospital days per person-year survived (5.2 vs 2.6), and higher hospital charges per person-year survived (\$3731 vs \$1841).


{CONCLUSION}

Eight easily ascertained risk factors affect elders' probability of being hospitalized repeatedly within four years. In the future, brief surveys about the presence of these factors could be used to estimate elders' risk of future hospitalization and, thereby, to identify some of those who may derive the greatest benefit from interventions designed to avert the need for hospitalization.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

In 2009, the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services is publicly reporting hospital-level risk-standardized 30-day mortality and readmission rates after acute myocardial infarction ({AMI)} and heart failure ({HF).} We provide patterns of hospital performance, based on these measures.


{METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}

We calculated the 30-day mortality and readmission rates for all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries ages 65 years or older with a primary diagnosis of {AMI} or {HF}, discharged between July 2005 and June 2008. We compared weighted risk-standardized mortality and readmission rates across Hospital Referral Regions and hospital structural characteristics. The median 30-day mortality rate was 16.6\% for {AMI} (range, 10.9\% to 24.9\%; 25th to 75th percentile, 15.8\% to 17.4\%; 10th to 90th percentile, 14.7\% to 18.4\%) and 11.1\% for {HF} (range, 6.6\% to 19.8\%; 25th to 75th percentile, 10.3\% to 12.0\%; 10th to 90th percentile, 9.4\% to 13.1\%). The median 30-day readmission rate was 19.9\% for {AMI} (range, 15.3\% to 29.4\%; 25th to 75th percentile, 19.5\% to 20.4\%; 10th to 90th percentile, 18.8\% to 21.1\%) and 24.4\% for {HF} (range, 15.9\% to 34.4\%; 25th to 75th percentile, 23.4\% to 25.6\%; 10th to 90th percentile, 22.3\% to 27.0\%). We observed geographic differences in performance across the country. Although there were some differences in average performance by hospital characteristics, there were high and low hospital performers among all types of hospitals.


{CONCLUSIONS}

In a recent 3-year period, 30-day risk-standardized mortality rates for {AMI} and {HF} varied among hospitals and across the country. The readmission rates were particularly high.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Readmissions to hospital are increasingly being used as an indicator of quality of care. However, this approach is valid only when we know what proportion of readmissions are avoidable. We conducted a systematic review of studies that measured the proportion of readmissions deemed avoidable. We examined how such readmissions were measured and estimated their prevalence.


{METHODS}

We searched the {MEDLINE} and {EMBASE} databases to identify all studies published from 1966 to July 2010 that reviewed hospital readmissions and that specified how many were classified as avoidable.


{RESULTS}

Our search strategy identified 34 studies. Three of the studies used combinations of administrative diagnostic codes to determine whether readmissions were avoidable. Criteria used in the remaining studies were subjective. Most of the studies were conducted at single teaching hospitals, did not consider information from the community or treating physicians, and used only one reviewer to decide whether readmissions were avoidable. The median proportion of readmissions deemed avoidable was 27.1\% but varied from 5\% to 79\%. Three study-level factors (teaching status of hospital, whether all diagnoses or only some were considered, and length of follow-up) were significantly associated with the proportion of admissions deemed to be avoidable and explained some, but not all, of the heterogeneity between the studies.


{INTERPRETATION}

All but three of the studies used subjective criteria to determine whether readmissions were avoidable. Study methods had notable deficits and varied extensively, as did the proportion of readmissions deemed avoidable. The true proportion of hospital readmissions that are potentially avoidable remains unclear.},

	abstract = {This article describes a new case-mix methodology applicable primarily to the ambulatory care sector. The Ambulatory Care Group ({ACG)} system provides a conceptually simple, statistically valid, and clinically relevant measure useful in predicting the utilization of ambulatory health services within a particular population group. {ACGs} are based on a person's demographic characteristics and their pattern of disease over an extended period of time, such as a year. Specifically, the {ACG} system is driven by a person's age, sex, and {ICD-9-CM} diagnoses assigned during patient-provider encounters; it does not require any special data beyond those collected routinely by insurance claims systems or encounter forms. The categorization scheme does not depend on the presence of specific diagnoses that may change over time; rather it is based on broad clusters of diagnoses and conditions. The presence or absence of each disease cluster, along with age and sex, are used to classify a person into one of 51 {ACG} categories. The {ACG} system has been developed and tested using computerized encounter and claims data from more than 160,000 continuous enrollees at four large {HMOs} and a state's Medicaid program. The {ACG} system can explain more than 50\% of the variance in ambulatory resource use if used retrospectively and more than 20\% if applied prospectively. This compares with 6\% when age and sex alone are used. In addition to describing {ACG} development and validation, this article also explores some potential applications of the system for provider payment, quality assurance, utilization review, and health services research, particularly as it relates to capitated settings.},

Readmission soon after hospital discharge is an expensive and often preventable event for patients with heart failure. We present a model approved by the National Quality Forum for the purpose of public reporting of hospital-level readmission rates by the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services.


{METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}

We developed a hierarchical logistic regression model to calculate hospital risk-standardized 30-day all-cause readmission rates for patients hospitalized with heart failure. The model was derived with the use of Medicare claims data for a 2004 cohort and validated with the use of claims and medical record data. The unadjusted readmission rate was 23.6\%. The final model included 37 variables, had discrimination ranging from 15\% observed 30-day readmission rate in the lowest predictive decile to 37\% in the upper decile, and had a c statistic of 0.60. The 25th and 75th percentiles of the risk-standardized readmission rates across 4669 hospitals were 23.1\% and 24.0\%, with 5th and 95th percentiles of 22.2\% and 25.1\%, respectively. The odds of all-cause readmission for a hospital 1 standard deviation above average was 1.30 times that of a hospital 1 standard deviation below average. State-level adjusted readmission rates developed with the use of the claims model are similar to rates produced for the same cohort with the use of a medical record model (correlation, 0.97; median difference, 0.06 percentage points).


{CONCLUSIONS}

This claims-based model of hospital risk-standardized readmission rates for heart failure patients produces estimates that may serve as surrogates for those derived from a medical record model.},

Essential components of effective programs included conducting organized surveillance and control activities and having a trained, effectual infection control physician, an infection control nurse per 250 beds, and a system for reporting infection rates to practicing surgeons. Programs with these components reduced their hospitals' infection rates by 32\%. Since relatively few hospitals had very effective programs, however, only 6\% of the nation's approximately 2 million nosocomial infections were being prevented in the mid-1970s, leaving another 26\% to be prevented by universal adoption of these programs.

	abstract = {The objective of the study was to develop and validate predictors of 30-day hospital readmission using readily available administrative data and to compare prediction models that use alternate comorbidity classifications. A retrospective cohort study was designed; the models were developed in a two-thirds random sample and validated in the remaining one-third sample. The study cohort consisted of 29,292 adults aged 65 or older who were admitted from July 2002 to June 2004 to any of seven acute care hospitals in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area affiliated with the Baylor Health Care System. Demographic variables (age, sex, race), health system variables (insurance, discharge location, medical vs surgical service), comorbidity (classified by the Elixhauser classification or the High-Risk Diagnoses in the Elderly Scale), and geographic variables (distance from patient's residence to hospital and median income) were assessed by estimating relative risk and risk difference for 30-day readmission. Population-attributable risk was calculated. Results showed that age 75 or older, male sex, African American race, medical vs surgical service, Medicare with no other insurance, discharge to a skilled nursing facility, and specific comorbidities predicted 30-day readmission. Models with demographic, health system, and either comorbidity classification covariates performed similarly, with modest discrimination (C statistic, 0.65) and acceptable calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow χ² = 6.08; P {\textgreater} 0.24). Models with demographic variables, health system variables, and number of comorbid conditions also performed adequately. Discharge to long-term care (relative risk, 1.94; 95\% confidence interval, 1.80- 2.09) had the highest population-attributable risk of 30-day readmission (12.86\%). A 25\% threshold of predicted probability of 30-day readmission identified 4.1 \% of patients ≥65 years old as priority patients for improved discharge planning. We conclude that elders with a high risk of 30-day hospital readmission can be identified early in their hospital course.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10738987},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

In 1991, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention devised the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance ({NNIS)} System risk index to stratify populations of surgical patients by the risk of acquiring surgical-site infections ({SSIs).}


{OBJECTIVE}

To determine whether the {NNIS} risk index adequately stratifies a population of cardiothoracic surgery patients by the risk of developing {SSI.}


{DESIGN}

Case-control study.


{SETTING}

The University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, a 900-bed, midwestern, tertiary-care hospital.


{PATIENTS}

201 patients with {SSIs} identified by prospective infection control surveillance and 398 controls matched by age, gender, type of procedure, and date of procedure. All patients underwent cardiothoracic operative procedures between November 1990 and January 1994.


{RESULTS}

The {SSI} rate was 7.8\%. Seventy-four percent of cases and 80\% of controls had a {NNIS} risk index score of 1; 24\% of cases and 16\% of controls had a score of 2 (P=.05). Patients with a {NNIS} risk score {\textgreater} or =2 were 1.8 times more likely to develop an {SSI} than those with a {NNIS} score {\textless}2 (odds ratio, 1.83; 95\% confidence interval, 1.14-2.94, P=.01). The duration of the procedure was the only component of the index that stratified the population by risk of {SSI.}


{CONCLUSIONS}

The risk of {SSI} after cardiothoracic operations increases as the {NNIS} risk index score increases. However, this index only dichotomized the patient population on the basis of the procedure duration. More research is needed to develop a risk index that adequately stratifies the risk of {SSI} after cardiothoracic operations.},

Patients residing in the Northeast had the lowest rates of rehospitalization, although their rehospitalizations tended to be lengthier than those elsewhere. Rehospitalization rates were also tracked for 9 months following discharge from the surgical stay. For all procedures, rehospitalization rates decreased during the 9 months after discharge, but they remained above the prevailing hospitalization rate for the Medicare aged population for the entire 9 months. Principal diagnoses associated with rehospitalizations within 30 days were often related to the body system on which surgery was initially performed, suggesting that many rehospitalizations are for continuing problems related to the initial condition that necessitated surgery.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Medication lists offer an alternative source of data on comorbidities and disease burden.


{OBJECTIVE}

To develop and validate the Medication-Based Disease Burden Index ({MDBI).}


{METHODS}

A list of medications corresponding to the leading causes of global death was pilot tested and finalized by an expert panel. The resulting index was tested on drug regimens of patients at risk of medication misadventure. Criterion validity of the index was established against Charlson's index and Chronic Disease Score ({CDS).} Sensitivity, specificity, predictive validity, convergent and discriminant validity, and interrater and test-retest reliabilities of the index were also assessed.


{RESULTS}

The {MDBI} consisting of specific medications for 20 chronic medical conditions and corresponding disability weightings was developed. The {MDBI} was tested on 317 patients with mean +/- {SD} Charlson's index scores of 2.8 +/- 2.2 and {CDS} scores of 7.3 +/- 2.8. Mean {MDBI} scores (0.33 +/- 0.28) demonstrated significant correlations with Charlson's index scores (r = 0.31; p {\textless} 0.001) and {CDS} (r = 0.53; p {\textless} 0.001). {MDBI} had satisfactory sensitivity and high specificity. Age of the patients and number of medications had significant correlation with the {MDBI} scores, but the {MDBI} scores were not significantly different in males and females. {MDBI} scores could successfully predict death and planned or unplanned readmissions ({OR} = 4.7, 95\% {CI} 1.4 to 15.5; p = 0.01). {MDBI} demonstrated high inter-rater (intraclass correlation coefficient [{ICC]} = 0.99) and test-retest reliabilities ({ICC} = 0.98).


{CONCLUSIONS}

Initial testing suggests that {MDBI} could offer an alternative low-cost and convenient method for quantifying disease burden and predicting health outcomes.},

Usual aging is often associated with functional change, such as a decline in muscle strength and aerobic capacity; vasomotor instability; reduced bone density; diminished pulmonary ventilation; altered sensory continence, appetite, and thirst; and a tendency toward urinary incontinence. Hospitalization and bed rest superimpose factors such as enforced immobilization, reduction of plasma volume, accelerated bone loss, increased closing volume, and sensory deprivation. Any of these factors may thrust vulnerable older persons into a state of irreversible functional decline. The factors that contribute to a cascade to dependency are identifiable and can be avoided by modification of the usual acute hospital environment by deemphasizing bed rest, removing the hazard of the high hospital bed with rails, and actively facilitating ambulation and socialization. The relationships among physicians, nurses, and other health professionals must reflect the importance of interdisciplinary care and the implementation of shared objectives.},

Medication claims are commonly used to calculate the risk adjustment for measuring healthcare cost. The Rx-defined Morbidity Groups (Rx-{MG)} which combine the use of medication to indicate morbidity have been incorporated into the Adjusted Clinical Groups ({ACG)} Case Mix System, developed by the Johns Hopkins University. This study aims to verify that the Rx-{MG} can be used for adjusting risk and for explaining the variations in the healthcare cost in Taiwan.


{METHODS}

The Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005 ({LHID2005)} was used in this study. The year 2006 was chosen as the baseline to predict healthcare cost (medication and total cost) in 2007. The final sample size amounted to 793,239 (81\%) enrolees, and excluded any cases with discontinued enrolment. Two different kinds of models were built to predict cost: the concurrent model and the prospective model. The predictors used in the predictive models included age, gender, Aggregated Diagnosis Groups ({ADG}, diagnosis- defined morbidity groups), and Rx-defined Morbidity Groups. Multivariate {OLS} regression was used in the cost prediction modelling.


{RESULTS}

The concurrent model adjusted for Rx-defined Morbidity Groups for total cost, and controlled for age and gender had a better predictive R-square = 0.618, compared to the model adjusted for {ADGs} (R2 = 0.411). The model combined with Rx-{MGs} and {ADGs} performed the best for concurrently predicting total cost (R2 = 0.650). For prospectively predicting total cost, the model combined Rx-{MGs} and {ADGs} (R2 = 0.382) performed better than the models adjusted by Rx-{MGs} (R2 = 0.360) or {ADGs} (R2 = 0.252) only. Similarly, the concurrent model adjusted for Rx-{MGs} predicting pharmacy cost had a better performance (R-square = 0.615), than the model adjusted for {ADGs} (R2 = 0.431). The model combined with Rx-{MGs} and {ADGs} performed the best in concurrently as well as prospectively predicting pharmacy cost (R2 = 0.638 and 0.505, respectively). The prospective models showed a remarkable improvement when adjusted by prior cost.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The medication-based Rx-Defined Morbidity Groups was useful in predicting pharmacy cost as well as total cost in Taiwan. Combining the information on medication and diagnosis as adjusters could arguably be the best method for explaining variations in healthcare cost.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

The purpose of this study was to provide a national estimate of the number of healthcare-associated infections ({HAI)} and deaths in United States hospitals.


{METHODS}

No single source of nationally representative data on {HAIs} is currently available. The authors used a multi-step approach and three data sources. The main source of data was the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance ({NNIS)} system, data from 1990-2002, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey (for 2002) and the American Hospital Association Survey (for 2000) were used to supplement {NNIS} data. The percentage of patients with an {HAI} whose death was determined to be caused or associated with the {HAI} from {NNIS} data was used to estimate the number of deaths.


{RESULTS}

In 2002, the estimated number of {HAIs} in {U.S.} hospitals, adjusted to include federal facilities, was approximately 1.7 million: 33,269 {HAIs} among newborns in high-risk nurseries, 19,059 among newborns in well-baby nurseries, 417,946 among adults and children in {ICUs}, and 1,266,851 among adults and children outside of {ICUs.} The estimated deaths associated with {HAIs} in {U.S.} hospitals were 98,987: of these, 35,967 were for pneumonia, 30,665 for bloodstream infections, 13,088 for urinary tract infections, 8,205 for surgical site infections, and 11,062 for infections of other sites.


{CONCLUSION}

{HAIs} in hospitals are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. The method described for estimating the number of {HAIs} makes the best use of existing data at the national level.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Studies of hospitalized patients identify safety as a significant problem, but few data are available regarding injuries occurring after discharge. Patients may be vulnerable during this transition period.


{OBJECTIVE}

To describe the incidence, severity, preventability, and "ameliorability" of adverse events affecting patients after discharge from the hospital and to develop strategies for improving patient safety during this interval.


{DESIGN}

Prospective cohort study.


{SETTING}

A tertiary care academic hospital.


{PATIENTS}

400 consecutive patients discharged home from the general medical service.


{MEASUREMENTS}

The three main outcomes were adverse events, defined as injuries occurring as a result of medical management; preventable adverse events, defined as adverse events judged to have been caused by an error; and ameliorable adverse events, defined as adverse events whose severity could have been decreased. Posthospital course was determined by performing a medical record review and a structured telephone interview approximately 3 weeks after each patient's discharge. Outcomes were determined by independent physician reviews.


{RESULTS}

Seventy-six patients had adverse events after discharge (19\% [95\% {CI}, 15\% to 23\%]). Of these, 23 had preventable adverse events (6\% [{CI}, 4\% to 9\%]) and 24 had ameliorable adverse events (6\% [{CI}, 4\% to 9\%]). Three percent of injuries were serious laboratory abnormalities, 65\% were symptoms, 30\% were symptoms associated with a nonpermanent disability, and 3\% were permanent disabilities. Adverse drug events were the most common type of adverse event (66\% [{CI}, 55\% to 76\%]), followed by procedure-related injuries (17\% [{CI}, 8\% to 26\%]). Of the 25 adverse events resulting in at least a nonpermanent disability, 12 were preventable (48\% [{CI}, 28\% to 68\%]) and 6 were ameliorable (24\% [{CI}, 7\% to 41\%]).


{CONCLUSION}

Adverse events occurred frequently in the peridischarge period, and many could potentially have been prevented or ameliorated with simple strategies.},

Medicine housestaff were randomized either to attend a clinic once a week in which they saw all eligible patients they had recently discharged from the hospital, or to continue with usual discharge practices. We enrolled 751 patients, 312 on intervention teams and 439 on control teams. Intervention housestaff did not feel that the clinic took too much time and felt that they better knew how patients did after discharge. Fewer intervention patients had emergency room visits (28.0\% to 20.8\%, p = .03) in the 30 days after discharge. Length of stay, readmission rates, and mortality were similar for the two groups. We conclude that a postdischarge clinic can improve resident education and reduce postdischarge emergency room utilization.},

{OBJECTIVES:} To determine the relationship between hospital nursing; that is, nurse work environment, nurse staffing levels, and nurse education, and 30-day readmissions among Medicare patients with heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, and pneumonia.
{METHOD} {AND} {DESIGN:} Analysis of linked data from California, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania that included information on the organization of hospital nursing (ie, work environment, patient-to-nurse ratios, and proportion of nurses holding a {BSN} degree) from a survey of nurses, as well as patient discharge data, and American Hospital Association Annual Survey data. Robust logistic regression was used to estimate the relationship between nursing factors and 30-day readmission.
{RESULTS:} Nearly 1 quarter of heart failure index admissions [23.3\% (n=39,954)], 19.1\% (n=12,131) of myocardial infarction admissions, and 17.8\% (n=25,169) of pneumonia admissions were readmitted within 30 days. Each additional patient per nurse in the average nurse's workload was associated with a 7\% higher odds of readmission for heart failure [odds ratio ({OR)=1.07;} confidence interval {CI}, 1.05-1.09], 6\% for pneumonia patients ({OR=1.06;} {CI}, 1.03-1.09), and 9\% for myocardial infarction patients ({OR=1.09;} {CI}, 1.05-1.13). Care in a hospital with a good versus poor work environment was associated with odds of readmission that were 7\% lower for heart failure ({OR=0.93;} {CI}, 0.89-0.97), 6\% lower for myocardial infarction ({OR=0.94;} {CI}, 0.88-0.98), and 10\% lower for pneumonia ({OR=0.90;} {CI}, 0.85-0.96) patients.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Improving nurses' work environments and staffing may be effective interventions for preventing readmissions.},

We devised a conceptual model for the use of unscheduled readmission within 31 days as an indicator of the quality of medical-surgical inpatient care for adults, and then conducted a systematic review of the readmission literature to determine the extent to which the evidence supports the proposed relationships. A fairly complex web of relationships influences the association between the process of inpatient care and early readmission. From the evidence to date, it is impossible to say with confidence that early readmission is or is not a valid and useful quality indicator. In most negative studies, the absence of an association appears to be explainable on the basis of improper study design, omission of important variables, or mis-specification of variables. Variables intervening between or confounding the relationship of the process of inpatient care to early readmission have received inadequate attention in past work. Investigators can use the proposed model and literature review to ensure their work advances the field and puts the hypothesis that early readmission is a valid quality indicator to a rigorous test. This matter has a certain urgency in view of the vast amount of resources that providers and payers devote to monitoring readmission rates and reviewing readmissions.},

Hip fractures are associated with high mortality, but the cause of this is still not entirely clear. We investigated the effect of surgical delay, weekends, holidays, and time of day admission on mortality in hip fracture patients.


{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS}

Using data from the Danish National Indicator Project, we identified 38,020 patients admitted from 2003 to 2010. Logistic regression analysis was used to study the association between sex, age, weekend or holiday admission, night-time admission, time to surgery, and {ASA} score on the one hand and mortality on the other.


{RESULTS}

The risk of death in hospital increased with surgical delay (odds ratio ({OR)} = 1.3 per 24 h of delay), {ASA} score ({OR} (per point added) = 2.3), sex ({OR} for men 2.2), and age ({OR} (per 5 years) = 1.4). The mortality rate for patients admitted during weekends or public holidays, or at night, was similar to that found for those admitted during working days.


{INTERPRETATION}

Minimizing surgical delay is the most important factor in reducing mortality in hip fracture patients.},

In this study, a soluble, divalent {HLA-A2} molecule was constructed with the Fc part of human {IgG1} and was pulsed with a peptide related to melanoma tyrosinase 368-376 [Tyr(368-376) (Tyr)] to form the {Tyr/HLA-A2} dimer, which allowed loading onto monocytes via interaction of the Fc and {FcR.} The {HLA-A2-negative} ({HLA-A2-ve)} monocytes loaded with the {Tyr/HLA-A2} dimer acted as allo-{APC} with copies of a single allogeneic epitope. After coculture of the {HLA-A2-ve} {PBLs} and autologous monocytes loaded with the dimer, {CD8+} cells in the coculture show an obvious proliferation and increased frequency of {Tyr/HLA-A2} tetramer-stained cells. The sorted {Tyr/HLA-A2} tetramer-positive {CD8+} cells display an elevated cytotoxic activity against {HLA-A2-positive} melanoma cells expressing tyrosinase endogenously (i.e., {SK-Mel-5)} but little against tyrosinase-negative melanoma cells (i.e., A375). The coculture of {PBLs} and autologous monocytes loaded with allogeneic {peptide/HLA} complexes offers a novel approach to expand allo-restricted, peptide-specific {CTLs}, which might be a potential arsenal for treatment of patients with malignant disease, if the tumor-related epitope were defined.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Medication discrepancies are unintended differences between medication regimens (ie, between a patient's home regimen and medications prescribed on admission to the hospital).


{OBJECTIVE}

The goal of this study was to describe the incidence, drug classes, and probable importance of hospital admission medication discrepancies and discharge regimen differences, and to determine whether factors such as age and specific hospital services were associated with greater frequency of medication discrepancies and differences.


{METHODS}

This was a retrospective cohort study of a random sample of adult patients admitted to the general medicine, cardiology, or general surgery services of a tertiary care academic teaching hospital between July 1, 2006, and August 31, 2006. A chart review was performed to collect the following information: patient demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, number of preadmission medications, discrepant medications identified by the hospital's reconciliation process, reasons for the discrepancies, and discharge medications that differed from the home regimen. Potentially high-risk discrepancies and differences were identified by determining if the medications were included on either the Institute for Safe Medication Practices high-alert list or the North Carolina Narrow Therapeutic Index list. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with medication discrepancies and differences.


{RESULTS}

Of the 205 patients (mean age, 59.9 years; 116 men, 89 women; 60\% white) included in the study, 27 did not have any medications recorded on admission. Of the 178 patients who did have medications listed, 41 had {\textgreater}or=1 discrepancy identified by the reconciliation process on admission (23\%; 95\% {CI}, 17-29); 19\% (95\% {CI}, 11-31) of these medications were considered to be potentially high risk. In the multivariate logistic regression model, age (odds ratio [{OR]} per 5-year increase = 1.16; 95\% {CI}, 1.01-1.33; P = 0.035), presence of high-risk medications on admission ({OR} = 76.68; 95\% {CI}, 9.13-643.76; P {\textless} 0.001), and general surgery service ({OR} = 3.31; 95\% {CI}, 1.40-7.87; P {\textless} 0.007) were associated with a higher proportion of patients with discrepancies on admission. At discharge, 196 patients (96\% [95\% {CI}, 93{\textless}98]) had {\textgreater}or=1 medication change from their home regimen, with 1102 total differences for 205 patients. Less than half (44\% [95\% {CI}, 37-51]) of these patients were explicitly alerted at discharge to new medications or dose changes; 12\% (95\% {CI}, 7-18) were given written instructions to stop taking discontinued home medications. Cardiovascular drugs were the most frequent class involved at both admission (31\%) and discharge (27\%) in medication discrepancies or differences.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Medication discrepancies on admission and medication differences at discharge were prevalent for adult patients admitted to the general medicine, cardiology, and general surgery services in this academic teaching hospital. Medication reconciliation processes have a high potential to identify clinically important discrepancies for all patients.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

The level of staffing in hospitals is often lower on weekends than on weekdays, despite a presumably consistent day-to-day burden of disease. It is uncertain whether in-hospital mortality rates among patients with serious conditions differ according to whether they are admitted on a weekend or on a weekday.


{METHODS}

We analyzed all acute care admissions from emergency departments in Ontario, Canada, between 1988 and 1997 (a total of 3,789,917 admissions). We compared in-hospital mortality among patients admitted on a weekend with that among patients admitted on a weekday for three prespecified diseases: ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (5454 admissions), acute epiglottitis (1139), and pulmonary embolism (11,686) and for three control diseases: myocardial infarction (160,220), intracerebral hemorrhage (10,987), and acute hip fracture (59,670), as well as for the 100 conditions that were the most common causes of death (accounting for 1,820,885 admissions).


{RESULTS}

Weekend admissions were associated with significantly higher in-hospital mortality rates than were weekday admissions among patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (42 percent vs. 36 percent, P{\textless}0.001), acute epiglottitis (1.7 percent vs. 0.3 percent, P=0.04), and pulmonary embolism (13 percent vs. 11 percent, P=0.009). The differences in mortality persisted for all three diagnoses after adjustment for age, sex, and coexisting disorders. There were no significant differences in mortality between weekday and weekend admissions for the three control diagnoses. Weekend admissions were also associated with significantly higher mortality rates for 23 of the 100 leading causes of death and were not associated with significantly lower mortality rates for any of these conditions.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Patients with some serious medical conditions are more likely to die in the hospital if they are admitted on a weekend than if they are admitted on a weekday.},

Surveillance of these infections identifies secular trends and provides data upon which prevention interventions can be based in order to improve patient safety. National surveillance of healthcare-associated infections was initiated in the United States in 1970. Since that time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's ({CDC)} National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance ({NNIS)} system has provided standardized methods for collecting and comparing healthcare-associated infection rates and the national benchmark infection rate data for inter- and intra-hospital comparisons. The surveillance methods used and results of the implementation of these methods are reviewed. The number of hospitals participating in the {CDC's} national surveillance of healthcare-associated infections has grown from approximately ten to 20 hospitals in 1970 to over 300 hospitals in 2002. Over the years, {NNIS} system participants have used standardized definitions, standardized surveillance component protocols, risk stratification for calculation of infection rates and provided national benchmark infection rates for inter- and intra-hospital comparisons. These methods have resulted in a significant reduction in bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections and pneumonia in intensive care unit ({ICU)} patients and surgical site infections in surgical patients. The {NNIS} data show that national surveillance of healthcare-associated infections combined with an intervention prevention program can reduce infection rates, reduce morbidity and mortality and improve patient safety. Establishment of such healthcare-associated infection surveillance and prevention systems in countries throughout the world should be a priority.},

Previous studies have applied statistical methods to detect unexpected cases of disease in space or time. The objectives of our study were to assess the ability and timeliness of three spatio-temporal methods to detect known outbreaks of tuberculosis.
{METHODS:} We used routinely available molecular and surveillance data to retrospectively assess the effectiveness of three statistical methods in detecting tuberculosis outbreaks: county-based log-likelihood ratio, cumulative sums, and a spatial scan statistic.
{RESULTS:} Our methods identified 8 of the 9 outbreaks, and 6 outbreaks would have been identified 1-52 months (median=10 months) before local public health authorities identified them. Assuming no delays in data availability, 46 (59.7\%) of the 77 patients in the 9 outbreaks were identified after our statistical methods would have detected the outbreak but before local public health authorities became aware of the problem.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Statistical methods, when applied retrospectively to routinely collected tuberculosis data, can successfully detect known outbreaks, potentially months before local public health authorities become aware of the problem. The three methods showed similar results; no single method was clearly superior to the other two. Further study to elucidate the performance of these methods in detecting tuberculosis outbreaks will be done in a prospective analysis.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

A real-time electronic predictive model that identifies hospitalized heart failure ({HF)} patients at high risk for readmission or death may be valuable to clinicians and hospitals who care for these patients.


{METHODS}

An automated predictive model for 30-day readmission and death was derived and validated from clinical and nonclinical risk factors present on admission in 1372 {HF} hospitalizations to a major urban hospital between January 2007 and August 2008. Data were extracted from an electronic medical record. The performance of the electronic model was compared with mortality and readmission models developed by the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services ({CMS} models) and a {HF} mortality model derived from the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Registry ({ADHERE} model).


{RESULTS}

The 30-day mortality and readmission rates were 3.1\% and 24.1\% respectively. The electronic model demonstrated good discrimination for 30 day mortality (C statistic 0.86) and readmission (C statistic 0.72) and performed as well, or better than, the {ADHERE} model and {CMS} models for both outcomes (C statistic ranges: 0.72-0.73 and 0.56-0.66 for mortality and readmissions respectively; P {\textless} 0.05 in all comparisons). Markers of social instability and lower socioeconomic status improved readmission prediction in the electronic model (C statistic 0.72 vs. 0.61, P {\textless} 0.05).


{CONCLUSIONS}

Clinical and social factors available within hours of hospital presentation and extractable from an {EMR} predicted mortality and readmission at 30 days. Incorporating complex social factors increased the model's accuracy, suggesting that such factors could enhance risk adjustment models designed to compare hospital readmission rates.},

To assess the feasibility of extracting data on readmissions and readmission rates from Körner data for use as health service indicators.


{DESIGN}

Retrospective analysis of inpatient Körner data for January 1988 to April 1989.


{SETTING}

Three districts in North East Thames region.


{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}

Number of readmissions after index discharge for all acute specialties combined and by specialty (general medicine, general surgery, gynaecology, trauma and orthopaedics, and geriatrics); readmission rates at 28 days after index discharge; and rates standardised for age group and sex by specialty and by consultant.


{RESULTS}

All specialties showed an early peak in number of admissions, which levelled off by 28 days. Readmission rates at 28 days were appreciably lower in surgical specialties than in medical specialties (for example, general surgery 4.1\% v geriatric medicine 15.1\%). They were related to age and sex of the patient. Rates standardised for these variables did not significantly differ by district. Likewise, significant differences in standardised rates were not obtained for consultants within a specialty in one district.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Readmission rates may be measured with Körner data. The pattern of readmissions with time means that readmission rates should be measured at not more than 28 days after the index discharge; the rates require standardisation for age and sex. Annual comparisons of standardised rates may be made among districts for combinations of specialties; those among individual consultants or specialties are unlikely to be statistically valid.},

While a strategy of targeted testing and treatment of persons most likely to develop tuberculosis is attractive, it is uncertain how best to accomplish this goal. In this study we seek to identify geographical areas where on-going tuberculosis transmission is occurring by linking Geographic Information Systems ({GIS)} technology with molecular surveillance. {METHODS:} This cross-sectional analysis was performed on data collected on persons newly diagnosed with culture positive tuberculosis at the Tarrant County Health Department ({TCHD)} between January 1, 1993 and December 31, 2000. Clinical isolates were molecularly characterized using {IS6110-based} {RFLP} analysis and spoligotyping methods to identify patients infected with the same strain. Residential addresses at the time of diagnosis of tuberculosis were geocoded and mapped according to strain characterization. Generalized estimating equations ({GEE)} analysis models were used to identify risk factors involved in clustering. {RESULTS:} Evaluation of the spatial distribution of cases within zip-code boundaries identified distinct areas of geographical distribution of same strain disease. We identified these geographical areas as having increased likelihood of on-going transmission. Based on this evidence we plan to perform geographically based screening and treatment programs. {CONCLUSION:} Using {GIS} analysis combined with molecular epidemiological surveillance may be an effective method for identifying instances of local transmission. These methods can be used to enhance targeted screening and control efforts, with the goal of interruption of disease transmission and ultimately incidence reduction.},

Furthermore, randomized prospective trials have shown that 12\% to 75\% of all readmissions can be prevented by patient education, predischarge assessment, and domiciliary aftercare. We conclude that most readmissions seem to be caused by unmodifiable causes, and that, pending an agreed-on method to adjust for confounders, global readmission rates are not a useful indicator of quality of care. However, high readmission rates of patients with defined conditions, such as diabetes and bronchial asthma, may identify quality-of-care problems. A focus on the specific needs of such patients may lead to the creation of more responsive health care systems for the chronically ill.},

A retrospective cohort study was designed; the models were developed in a two-thirds random sample and validated in the remaining one-third sample. The study cohort consisted of 29,292 adults aged 65 or older who were admitted from July 2002 to June 2004 to any of seven acute care hospitals in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area affiliated with the Baylor Health Care System. Demographic variables (age, sex, race), health system variables (insurance, discharge location, medical vs surgical service), comorbidity (classified by the Elixhauser classification or the High-Risk Diagnoses in the Elderly Scale), and geographic variables (distance from patient's residence to hospital and median income) were assessed by estimating relative risk and risk difference for 30-day readmission. Population-attributable risk was calculated. Results showed that age 75 or older, male sex, African American race, medical vs surgical service, Medicare with no other insurance, discharge to a skilled nursing facility, and specific comorbidities predicted 30-day readmission. Models with demographic, health system, and either comorbidity classification covariates performed similarly, with modest discrimination (C statistic, 0.65) and acceptable calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow χ² = 6.08; P {\textgreater} 0.24). Models with demographic variables, health system variables, and number of comorbid conditions also performed adequately. Discharge to long-term care (relative risk, 1.94; 95\% confidence interval, 1.80- 2.09) had the highest population-attributable risk of 30-day readmission (12.86\%). A 25\% threshold of predicted probability of 30-day readmission identified 4.1 \% of patients ≥65 years old as priority patients for improved discharge planning. We conclude that elders with a high risk of 30-day hospital readmission can be identified early in their hospital course.},

	abstract = {The development of {PCR-based} genotyping modalities (spoligotyping and mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable-number tandem repeat [{MIRU-VNTR]} typing) offers promise for real-time molecular epidemiological studies of tuberculosis ({TB).} However, the utility of these methods depends on their capacity to appropriately classify isolates. To determine the operating parameters of spoligotyping and {MIRU-VNTR} typing, we have compared results generated by these newer tests to the standard typing method, {IS6110} restriction fragment length polymorphism, in analyses restricted to high-copy-number {IS6110} isolates. Sensitivities of the newer tests were estimated as the percentages of isolates with identical {IS6110} fingerprints that had identical spoligotypes and {MIRU-VNTR} types. The specificities of these tests were estimated as the percentages of isolates with unique {IS6110} fingerprints that had unique spoligotypes and {MIRU-VNTR} types. The sensitivity of {MIRU-VNTR} typing was 52\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI]}, 31 to 72\%), and the sensitivity of spoligotyping was 83\% (95\% {CI}, 63 to 95\%). The specificity of {MIRU-VNTR} typing was 56\% (95\% {CI}, 51 to 62\%), and the specificity of spoligotyping was 40\% (95\% {CI}, 35 to 46\%). The proportion of isolates estimated to be due to recent transmission was 4\% by identical {IS6110} patterns, 19\% by near-identical {IS6110} patterns, 33\% by {MIRU-VNTR} typing, and 53\% by spoligotyping. The low calculated specificities of spoligotyping and {MIRU-VNTR} typing led to misclassification of cases, inflated estimates of {TB} transmission, and low positive predictive values, suggesting that these techniques have unsuitable operating parameters for population-based molecular epidemiology studies.},

Aggregation of spatial data is intended to protect privacy, but some effects of aggregation on spatial methods have not yet been quantified.


{METHODS}

We generated 3,000 spatial data sets and evaluated power of detection at 12 different levels of aggregation using the spatial scan statistic implemented in {SaTScan} v6.0.


{RESULTS}

Power to detect clusters decreased from nearly 100\% when using exact locations to roughly 40\% at the coarsest level of spatial resolution.

	doi = {10.1164/rccm.200702-187OC},
	abstract = {{RATIONALE}

Programs to prevent the incidence rate of tuberculosis ({TB)} from increasing in many low-incidence countries are challenged by international travel and immigration from high-burden countries.


{OBJECTIVES}

The current study aimed to determine the effect of such immigration on the genetic diversity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in an entire nation's population during 1994-2005.


{METHODS}

A total of 3,131 patients were notified with {TB} during the 12-year period. Of these, 2,284 (73\%) had {TB} verified by culture, and isolates from 2,173 (96\%) of these were analyzed by {IS6110} restriction fragment length polymorphism.


{MEASUREMENTS} {AND} {MAIN} {RESULTS}

Only 31\% of the included strains were isolated from nonimmigrants, the remaining 69\% were isolated from immigrants. Although the incidence increased throughout the period, the genetic diversity remained high. A total of 135 clusters were identified; the percentage of recent disease was reduced among nonimmigrants, and remained stable among the immigrants during the study period. Although 69\% of the isolates originated from immigrants from high-incidence countries, the established {TB} control program in the receiving country was adequate for the prevention of disease transmission. On average per year, only 2 nonimmigrants and 13 immigrants developed disease as a result of infection within the country by imported M. tuberculosis.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Twelve years of M. tuberculosis importation as a result of immigration from high-incidence countries had little influence on the transmission of this pathogen in the receiving low-incidence country. To prevent future increase of transmission of {TB}, the current control strategies of low-incidence countries are adequate but must be maintained.},

To use routine data to identify patients at high risk of future emergency hospital admissions.


{DESIGN}

Descriptive analysis of inpatient hospital episode statistics. Predictive model developed using multiple logistic regression.


{SETTING}

National Health Service hospital trusts in England.


{PARTICIPANTS}

All patients with an emergency admission to an {NHS} hospital between 1 April 2000 and 31 March 2001.


{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}

{'High-impact} users' were defined as patients who had at least one emergency inpatient admission and who then went on to have at least two further emergency hospital admissions in the 12 months following the start date of that index admission.


{RESULTS}

2,895,234 patients were admitted as emergencies in 2000/2001, of whom 147,725 (5.1\%) did not survive their first spell. Of the 2,747,509 surviving patients, 269,686 (9.8\%) subsequently had at least two or more emergency admissions within 365 days of the index date of admission. A further 236,779 (8.6\%) died during this period. Risk factors for becoming a high-impact user included the number of emergencies in the 36 months before index spell, comorbidity, age, an admission for an ambulatory care sensitive condition, ethnicity, area-level socioeconomic data, local admission rates, the number of episodes in the index spell, sex and the source of admission. The predictive model based on all emergency admissions produced a receiver operating characteristic curve score of 0.72.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Routine hospital episode statistics can be used to identify patients who are at high risk of suffering future multiple emergency hospital admissions. The potential cost savings in preventing a proportion of these subsequent admissions need to be compared with the costs of case management of these patients.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}

Few studies have attempted to validate the diagnostic information contained within medical service claims data, and only a small proportion of these have attempted to do so using the medical chart as a gold standard. The goal of this study is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of medical services claims diagnoses for surveillance of 14 drug disease contraindications used in drug utilization review, the Charlson comorbidity index and the Johns Hopkins Adjusted Care Group Case-Mix profile ({ADGs).}


{STUDY} {DESIGN} {AND} {SETTING}

Diagnoses were abstracted from the medical charts of 14,980 patients, and were used as the "gold standard," against which diagnoses obtained from the administrative database for the same patients were compared.


{RESULTS}

Conditions associated with drug disease contraindications with the exception of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD)} showed a specificity of 90\% or higher. Sensitivity of claims data was substantially lower, with glaucoma, hypertension, and diabetes being the most sensitive conditions at 76, 69, and 64\%, respectively. Each of the 18 disease conditions contained in the Charlson comorbidity index showed high specificity, but sensitivity was more variable among conditions as well as by coding definitions. Although {ADG} specificity was also high, the vast majority of {ADGs} had sensitivities of less than 60\%.


{CONCLUSION}

The administrative data was found to have diagnoses and conditions that were highly specific but that vary greatly by condition in terms of sensitivity. To appropriately obtain diagnostic profiles, it is recommended that data pertaining to all physician billings be used.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Although syndromic surveillance is increasingly used to detect unusual illness, there is a debate whether it is useful for detecting local outbreaks. We evaluated whether syndromic surveillance detects local outbreaks of lower-respiratory infections ({LRIs)} without swamping true signals by false alarms.


{METHODS} {AND} {FINDINGS}

Using retrospective hospitalization data, we simulated prospective surveillance for {LRI-elevations.} Between 1999-2006, a total of 290762 {LRIs} were included by date of hospitalization and patients place of residence ({\textgreater}80\% coverage, 16 million population). Two large outbreaks of Legionnaires disease in the Netherlands were used as positive controls to test whether these outbreaks could have been detected as local {LRI} elevations. We used a space-time permutation scan statistic to detect {LRI} clusters. We evaluated how many {LRI-clusters} were detected in 1999-2006 and assessed likely causes for the cluster-signals by looking for significantly higher proportions of specific hospital discharge diagnoses (e.g. Legionnaires disease) and overlap with regional influenza elevations. We also evaluated whether the number of space-time signals can be reduced by restricting the scan statistic in space or time. In 1999-2006 the scan-statistic detected 35 local {LRI} clusters, representing on average 5 clusters per year. The known Legionnaires' disease outbreaks in 1999 and 2006 were detected as {LRI-clusters}, since cluster-signals were generated with an increased proportion of Legionnaires disease patients (p:{\textless}0.0001). 21 other clusters coincided with local influenza and/or respiratory syncytial virus activity, and 1 cluster appeared to be a data artifact. For 11 clusters no likely cause was defined, some possibly representing as yet undetected {LRI-outbreaks.} With restrictions on time and spatial windows the scan statistic still detected the Legionnaires' disease outbreaks, without loss of timeliness and with less signals generated in time (up to 42\% decline).


{CONCLUSIONS}

To our knowledge this is the first study that systematically evaluates the performance of space-time syndromic surveillance with nationwide high coverage data over a longer period. The results show that syndromic surveillance can detect local {LRI-outbreaks} in a timely manner, independent of laboratory-based outbreak detection. Furthermore, since comparatively few new clusters per year were observed that would prompt investigation, syndromic hospital-surveillance could be a valuable tool for detection of local {LRI-outbreaks.}},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

The ability to detect disease outbreaks early is important in order to minimize morbidity and mortality through timely implementation of disease prevention and control measures. Many national, state, and local health departments are launching disease surveillance systems with daily analyses of hospital emergency department visits, ambulance dispatch calls, or pharmacy sales for which population-at-risk information is unavailable or irrelevant.


{METHODS} {AND} {FINDINGS}

We propose a prospective space-time permutation scan statistic for the early detection of disease outbreaks that uses only case numbers, with no need for population-at-risk data. It makes minimal assumptions about the time, geographical location, or size of the outbreak, and it adjusts for natural purely spatial and purely temporal variation. The new method was evaluated using daily analyses of hospital emergency department visits in New York City. Four of the five strongest signals were likely local precursors to citywide outbreaks due to rotavirus, norovirus, and influenza. The number of false signals was at most modest.


{CONCLUSION}

If such results hold up over longer study times and in other locations, the space-time permutation scan statistic will be an important tool for local and national health departments that are setting up early disease detection surveillance systems.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Reducing rates of rehospitalization has attracted attention from policymakers as a way to improve quality of care and reduce costs. However, we have limited information on the frequency and patterns of rehospitalization in the United States to aid in planning the necessary changes.


{METHODS}

We analyzed Medicare claims data from 2003-2004 to describe the patterns of rehospitalization and the relation of rehospitalization to demographic characteristics of the patients and to characteristics of the hospitals.


{RESULTS}

Almost one fifth (19.6\%) of the 11,855,702 Medicare beneficiaries who had been discharged from a hospital were rehospitalized within 30 days, and 34.0\% were rehospitalized within 90 days; 67.1\% [corrected] of patients who had been discharged with medical conditions and 51.5\% of those who had been discharged after surgical procedures were rehospitalized or died within the first year after discharge. In the case of 50.2\% [corrected] of the patients who were rehospitalized within 30 days after a medical discharge to the community, there was no bill for a visit to a physician's office between the time of discharge and rehospitalization. Among patients who were rehospitalized within 30 days after a surgical discharge, 70.5\% were rehospitalized for a medical condition. We estimate that about 10\% of rehospitalizations were likely to have been planned. The average stay of rehospitalized patients was 0.6 day longer than that of patients in the same diagnosis-related group whose most recent hospitalization had been at least 6 months previously. We estimate that the cost to Medicare of unplanned rehospitalizations in 2004 was \$17.4 billion.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Rehospitalizations among Medicare beneficiaries are prevalent and costly.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

The World Health Organization has declared tuberculosis a global emergency in 1993. It has been estimated that one third of the world population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. The emergence of {TB/HIV} co-infection poses an additional challenge for the control of tuberculosis throughout the world. The World Health Organization is supporting many developing countries to eradicate tuberculosis. It is an agony that one fifth of the tuberculosis patients worldwide are in India. The eradication of tuberculosis is the greatest public health challenge for this developing country. The aim of the present population based study on Mycobacterium tuberculosis is to test a large set of tuberculosis cases for the presence of statistically significant geographical clusters. A spatial scan statistic is used to identify purely spatial and space-time clusters of tuberculosis.


{RESULTS}

Significant (p {\textless} 0.05 for primary clusters and p {\textless} 0.1 for secondary clusters) high rate spatial and space-time clusters were identified in three areas of the district.


{CONCLUSION}

There is sufficient evidence about the existence of statistically significant tuberculosis clusters in Almora district of Uttaranchal, India. The spatial scan statistics methodology used in this study has a potential use in surveillance of tuberculosis for detecting the true clusters of the disease.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

To determine the prevalence of medical errors related to the discontinuity of care from an inpatient to an outpatient setting, and to determine if there is an association between these medical errors and adverse outcomes.


{PATIENTS}

Eighty-six patients who had been hospitalized on the medicine service at a large academic medical center and who were subsequently seen by their primary care physicians at the affiliated outpatient practice within 2 months after discharge.


{DESIGN}

Each patient's inpatient and outpatient medical record was reviewed for the presence of 3 types of errors related to the discontinuity of care from the inpatient to the outpatient setting: medication continuity errors, test follow-up errors, and work-up errors.


{MEASUREMENTS}

Rehospitalizations within 3 months after the initial postdischarge outpatient primary care visit.


{MAIN} {RESULTS}

Forty-nine percent of patients experienced at least 1 medical error. Patients with a work-up error were 6.2 times (95\%confidence interval [95\% {CI]}, 1.3 to 30.3) more likely to be rehospitalized within 3 months after the first outpatient visit. We did not find a statistically significant association between medication continuity errors (odds ratio [{OR]}, 2.5; {95\%CI}, 0.7 to 8.8) and test follow-up errors ({OR}, 2.4; {95\%CI}, 0.3 to 17.1) with rehospitalizations.


{CONCLUSION}

We conclude that the prevalence of medical errors related to the discontinuity of care from the inpatient to the outpatient setting is high and may be associated with an increased risk of rehospitalization.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}

To help resolve the current controversy over the validity of early readmission as an indicator of the quality of care, the authors critically reviewed the literature using meta-analysis to derive summary estimates of effect and evaluate inter-study heterogeneity.


{METHODS}

The authors selected reports meeting five criteria: (1) presentation of new data on medical-surgical hospitalization of adults; (2) measurement of outcome as a person-specific readmission; (3) readmission within {\textless} or = 31 days; (4) examination of some aspect of the process of inpatient care; (5) inclusion of a comparison group. One meta-analysis examined 13 comparisons of readmission rates after substandard versus normative care, another examined 9 comparisons of readmission rates after normative versus exceptional care, and the third examined all 22 comparisons together. Two authors applied inclusion criteria and extracted data on methods and findings. Two others classified studies on 11 methodological variables for the heterogeneity evaluation.


{RESULTS}

The summary odds ratio for readmission after substandard care was 1.24 (0.99-1.57) relative to normative care; for readmission after normative care the summary odds ratio was 1.45 (0.90-2.33) relative to exceptional care. The individual odds ratios varied significantly (chi2, 21 df = 50.34, P = 0.0003). Most of the variance in study odds ratios could be explained by whether the study focused on the quality of patient care or the qualifications of patient care providers. The summary odds ratio for the 16 homogeneous comparisons focusing on the quality of patient care was 1.55 (1.25-1.92).


{CONCLUSIONS}

Early readmission is significantly associated with the process of inpatient care. The risk of early readmission is increased by 55\% when care is of relatively low quality, that is, substandard or normative instead of normative or exceptional.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

The statistics of disease clustering is one of the most important tools for epidemiologists to detect and monitor public health disease patterns. Nowadays, tuberculosis ({TB)--an} infectious disease caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis--presents different (development in populations and antibiotics resistance) patterns and specialists are very concerned with it and its association to several other diseases and factors. Each year, tuberculosis kills about three million people in the world. In particular, it is responsible for the death of more than one-third of {HIV-infected} people, who prove particularly susceptible due to a decline in their immune defences. The purpose of this study is to determine if there are spatiotemporal tuberculosis incidence clusters in continental Portugal. The presented case study is based on the notification of new tuberculosis cases (disease incidence), between 2000 and 2004. In methodological terms, the spatial scan statistic, used to identify spatiotemporal clusters, was improved by including two new approaches: definition of window sizes in the cluster scanning processes considering empirical mean spatial semivariograms and an independent and posterior validation of identified clusters (based on geostatistical simulations).


{RESULTS}

Continental Portugal is organized in 18 districts with 278 sub-districts. For this case study, the number of new notified cases of {TB}, per sub-district and per year (2000-2004) was available. {TB} incidence presents clear spatial patterns: a semivariogram consistent with 40\% of nugget effect and 60\% of spatial contribution, following an exponential model with a range of 143 kilometres. Temporal semivariograms were not conclusive, as only 5 years of data were available. The spatial and temporal persistence of clusters were analyzed considering different models. Significant high incidence rate space-time clusters were identified in three areas of Portugal (between 2000 and 2004) and a purely temporal cluster was identified covering the whole country, during 2002.


{CONCLUSION}

In terms of spatiotemporal clustering of tuberculosis disease, the proposed methodology allowed the identification of critical spatiotemporal areas. In Portugal there were 3 critical districts (Porto, Setúbal and Lisbon) with high rates of notified incidences between 2000 and 2004. In methodological terms, semivariogram parameters were successfully applied to define spatiotemporal scan window sizes and shapes (ellipsoidal cylinders), showing very good results and performances in the case study. After defining the clusters, these were authenticated through a validation method, based on geostatistical simulations.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

The purpose of this study was to provide a national estimate of the number of healthcare-associated infections ({HAI)} and deaths in United States hospitals.


{METHODS}

No single source of nationally representative data on {HAIs} is currently available. The authors used a multi-step approach and three data sources. The main source of data was the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance ({NNIS)} system, data from 1990-2002, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey (for 2002) and the American Hospital Association Survey (for 2000) were used to supplement {NNIS} data. The percentage of patients with an {HAI} whose death was determined to be caused or associated with the {HAI} from {NNIS} data was used to estimate the number of deaths.


{RESULTS}

In 2002, the estimated number of {HAIs} in {U.S.} hospitals, adjusted to include federal facilities, was approximately 1.7 million: 33,269 {HAIs} among newborns in high-risk nurseries, 19,059 among newborns in well-baby nurseries, 417,946 among adults and children in {ICUs}, and 1,266,851 among adults and children outside of {ICUs.} The estimated deaths associated with {HAIs} in {U.S.} hospitals were 98,987: of these, 35,967 were for pneumonia, 30,665 for bloodstream infections, 13,088 for urinary tract infections, 8,205 for surgical site infections, and 11,062 for infections of other sites.


{CONCLUSION}

{HAIs} in hospitals are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. The method described for estimating the number of {HAIs} makes the best use of existing data at the national level.},

Routine data recorded in the Hospital Information System on all admissions to the Regional Public Hospital of Betim, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, from July 1996 to June 2000 were analyzed. Cox proportional hazards model and variants designed to deal with multiple-events data, like Andersen-Gill ({AG)}, Prentice, Williams and Peterson ({PWP)}, and random effects models were fitted to time between hospital admissions or censoring. For comparison purposes, a Poisson model was fitted to the total number of readmissions, using the same covariates. We analyzed 31,648 admissions of 26,198 patients, including 17,096 adults and 9,102 children. Estimates for the {PWP} and frailty models were very similar, and both approaches should be fitted and compared. If clinical characteristics are available, the {PWP} model should be used. Otherwise the random effects model can account for unmeasured differences, particularly some related to severity of the disease. These methodologies can help focus on various related readmission aspects such as diagnostic groups or medical specialties.},

In this article, we consider the regression analysis of such multivariate failure time observations. Each marginal distribution of the failure times is formulated by a Cox proportional hazards model. No specific structure of dependence among the distinct failure times on each subject is imposed. The regression parameters in the Cox models are estimated by maximizing the failure-specific partial likelihoods. The resulting estimators are shown to be asymptotically jointly normal with a covariance matrix that can be consistently estimated. Simultaneous inferential procedures are then proposed. Extensive Monte Carlo studies indicate that the normal approximation is adequate for practical use. The new methods allow time-dependent covariates, missing observations, and arbitrary patterns of censorship. They are illustrated with two real-life examples. For recurrent failure time data, various regression methods have been proposed in the literature. These methods, however, generally assume stringent structures of dependence among the recurrences of each subject. Moreover, as shown in the present article, they are rather sensitive to model misspecification.},

{OBJECTIVE:} To investigate three approaches to learning hospital-specific predictions about the risk of hospital-associated infection with Clostridium difficile, and perform a comparative analysis of the value of different ways of using external data to enhance hospital-specific predictions.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} We evaluated each approach on 132 853 admissions from three hospitals, varying in size and location. The first approach was a single-task approach, in which only training data from the target hospital (ie, the hospital for which the model was intended) were used. The second used only data from the other two hospitals. The third approach jointly incorporated data from all hospitals while seeking a solution in the target space.
{RESULTS:} The relative performance of the three different approaches was found to be sensitive to the hospital selected as the target. However, incorporating data from all hospitals consistently had the highest performance.
{DISCUSSION:} The results characterize the challenges and opportunities that come with (1) using data or models from collections of hospitals without adapting them to the site at which the model will be used, and (2) using only local data to build models for small institutions or rare events.
{CONCLUSIONS:} We show how external data from other hospitals can be successfully and efficiently incorporated into hospital-specific models.},

	abstract = {Research on adverse outcomes following common surgical procedures has suggested the importance of hospital and surgeon variables. Policy directions depend on which factors are important in influencing patient outcomes and what sorts of policies are feasible. Focusing on where a given procedure is performed highlights a concern for centralization; emphasizing who should perform a particular operation implies physician certification. Finally, monitoring involves identifying particular hospitals that appear to have relatively poor (or relatively good) results. This paper analyzes patient, surgeon, and hospital characteristics associated with serious postdischarge complications of hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and prostatectomy in patients age 25 and over in Manitoba, Canada, following surgery during 1974 through 1976. The three procedures differ markedly in the ease of prediction of the probability of complications and in the predictive importance of patient, hospital, and physician variables. The predictors worked fairly well for cholecystectomy, somewhat less well for hysterectomy, and not well at all for prostatectomy. Hospital variables were not generally important in the multiple logistic regressions. After controlling for case mix and type of surgery, physician surgical experience was found to account for relatively large differences (almost two to one) in the probability of patient complications following cholecystectomy. Cholecystectomy might be a candidate for certification because of the epidemiology of the operation. As of the mid-1970s, a substantial proportion of the cholecystectomies were being performed by physicians with comparatively little ongoing experience with this type of procedure. Moreover, a monitoring perspective identified one hospital with a significantly higher postcholecystectomy complication rate, even after physician experience was taken into account. Both identifying which procedures should be attended to and focusing on problems following surgery are important beyond Manitoba and highly relevant to such American requirements as Peer Review Organizations. Methods of increasing the efficiency of using claims data for quality assurance studies are outlined.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Patients are often treated in hospital by physicians other than their regular community doctor. After they are discharged, their care is often returned to their regular community doctor and patients may not see the hospital physician. Transfer of information between physicians can be poor. We determined whether early postdischarge outcomes changed when patients were seen after discharge by physicians who treated them in the hospital.


{METHODS}

This cohort study used population-based administrative databases to follow 938833 adults from Ontario, Canada, after they were discharged alive from a nonelective medical or surgical hospitalization between April 1, 1995, and March 1, 2000. We determined when patients were seen after discharge by physicians who treated them in the hospital, physicians who treated them 3 months prior to admission (community physicians), and specialists. The outcome of interest was 30-day death or nonelective readmission to hospital.


{RESULTS}

Of patients studied, 7.7\% died or were readmitted. The adjusted relative risk of death or readmission decreased by 5\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI]}, 4\% to 5\%) and 3\% (95\% {CI}, 2\% to 3\%) with each additional visit to a hospital physician rather than a community physician or specialist, respectively. The effect of hospital physician visits was cumulative, with the adjusted risk of 30-day death or nonelective readmission reduced to 7.3\%, 7.0\%, and 6.7\% if patients had 1, 2, or 3 visits, respectively, with a hospital rather than a community physician. The effect was consistent across important subgroups.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Patient outcomes could be improved if their early postdischarge visits were with physicians who treated them in hospital rather than with other physicians. Follow-up visits with a hospital physician, rather than another physician, could be a modifiable factor to improve patient outcomes following discharge from hospital.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Recent literature revealed that medication histories obtained by physicians and nurses are often incomplete. However, the number of patients included was often low. Study objective In this study, the authors compare medication histories obtained in the Emergency Department ({ED)} by pharmacists versus physicians and identify characteristics contributing to discrepancies.


{METHODS}

Medication histories were acquired by the pharmacist from patients admitted to the {ED}, planned to be hospitalised. A structured form was used to guide the pharmacist or technician to ensure a standardised approach. Discrepancies, defined as any difference between the pharmacist-acquired medication history and that obtained by the physician, were analysed.


{RESULTS}

3594 medication histories were acquired by pharmacy staff. 59\% (95\% {CI} 58.2\% to 59.8\%) of medication histories recorded by physicians were different from those obtained by the pharmacy staff. Within these inaccurate medication histories, 5963 discrepancies were identified. The most common type of error was omission of a drug (61\%; 95\% {CI} 60.4\% to 61.6\%), followed by omission of dose (18\%; 95\% {CI} 17.6\% to 18.4\%). Drugs belonging to the class of psycholeptics, acid suppressors and beta blocking agents were related to the highest discrepancy rate. Acetylsalicylic acid, omeprazole and zolpidem were most commonly forgotten.


{CONCLUSION}

This large prospective study demonstrates that medication history acquisition is very often incomplete in the {ED.} A structured form and a standardised method is necessary. Pharmacists are especially suited to acquire and supervise accurate medication histories, as they are educated and familiar with commonly used drugs.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}

Medication error prevention has become a priority in health care. The Joint Commission recommends that a list of medications, dosages, and allergies be obtained from all patients. The authors sought to determine the accuracy of medication history taking in emergency department ({ED)} triage. The hypothesis was that there would be significant discrepancies between medications listed in triage and those the patient was actually taking.


{METHODS}

This was a prospective, cross-sectional survey of adult patients presenting to the {ED.} As a part of regular care, nurses recorded a medication list during triage in the electronic medical record ({EMR).} For this study, the triage medication list was rechecked during an independent patient interview.


{RESULTS}

Of 1,797 patients approached, 1,657 completed the survey (92\%). The mean age was 39 years (standard deviation [{SD]} ±16 years). Discrepancies in medication lists obtained during triage were documented in 626 (37\%) patients. Discontinued medications (163, 9.8\%) were included, additional medications (463, 27.9\%) were omitted, and 632 patients (38\%) reported taking a nonprescription medication not listed in the {EMR.}

Medication histories performed in {ED} triage are inaccurate and incomplete.},

To assess the feasibility of extracting data on readmissions and readmission rates from Körner data for use as health service indicators.


{DESIGN}

Retrospective analysis of inpatient Körner data for January 1988 to April 1989.


{SETTING}

Three districts in North East Thames region.


{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}

Number of readmissions after index discharge for all acute specialties combined and by specialty (general medicine, general surgery, gynaecology, trauma and orthopaedics, and geriatrics); readmission rates at 28 days after index discharge; and rates standardised for age group and sex by specialty and by consultant.


{RESULTS}

All specialties showed an early peak in number of admissions, which levelled off by 28 days. Readmission rates at 28 days were appreciably lower in surgical specialties than in medical specialties (for example, general surgery 4.1\% v geriatric medicine 15.1\%). They were related to age and sex of the patient. Rates standardised for these variables did not significantly differ by district. Likewise, significant differences in standardised rates were not obtained for consultants within a specialty in one district.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Readmission rates may be measured with Körner data. The pattern of readmissions with time means that readmission rates should be measured at not more than 28 days after the index discharge; the rates require standardisation for age and sex. Annual comparisons of standardised rates may be made among districts for combinations of specialties; those among individual consultants or specialties are unlikely to be statistically valid.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Tuberculosis ({TB)} has reemerged as a global public health epidemic in recent years. Although evaluating local disease clusters leads to effective prevention and control of {TB}, there are few, if any, spatiotemporal comparisons for epidemic diseases.


{METHODS}

{TB} cases among residents in Fukuoka Prefecture between 1999 and 2004 (n = 9,119) were geocoded at the census tract level (n = 109) based on residence at the time of diagnosis. The spatial and space-time scan statistics were then used to identify clusters of census tracts with elevated proportions of {TB} cases.


{RESULTS}

In the purely spatial analyses, the most likely clusters were in the Chikuho coal mining area (in 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004), the Kita-Kyushu industrial area (in 2000), and the Fukuoka urban area (in 2001). In the space-time analysis, the most likely cluster was the Kita-Kyushu industrial area (in 2000). The north part of Fukuoka Prefecture was the most likely to have a cluster with a significantly high occurrence of {TB.}


{CONCLUSION}

The spatial and space-time scan statistics are effective ways of describing circular disease clusters. Since, in reality, infectious diseases might form other cluster types, the effectiveness of the method may be limited under actual practice. The sophistication of the analytical methodology, however, is a topic for future study.},

	abstract = {Rationale and objectives  Urgent readmission to hospital is commonly used to measure hospital quality of care. Hospitals that measure the proportion of urgent readmissions judged avoidable need to know previously published rates for comparison. In this study, we generated a literature-based estimate for the proportion of 30-day urgent readmissions deemed avoidable for hospitals to use to gauge their performance in avoidable readmissions. Methods  We searched the Medline and Embase databases to identify published studies that reported the proportion of 30-day urgent readmissions deemed avoidable. We then modelled the overall proportion of 30-day urgent readmissions deemed avoidable. Results  We included 16 studies that used a wide variety of patients and a diverse range of methods to classify readmissions as avoidable. Studies reported a broad range for the proportion of urgent 30-day readmissions deemed avoidable. Overall, 848 of 3669 readmissions (23.1\%, 95\% confidence interval, 21.7-24.5) of 30-day urgent readmissions were classified as avoidable. This proportion varied significantly based on hospital teaching status and number of reviewers for each case [teaching hospitals: with one reviewer, 9.3\% (4.2-19.3); with {\textgreater}1 reviewer, 21.6\% (13.2-33.3); non-teaching hospital: with one reviewer, 32.2\% (11.4-63.9); with {\textgreater}1 reviewer, 39.9\% (37.6-42.2)]. Significant heterogeneity remained between studies even after clustering studies by these covariates. Conclusions  Less than one in four readmissions were deemed avoidable. Health system planners need to use caution in interpreting all cause readmission statistics as they are only partially influenced by quality of care.},

Compared with no screening, radiographic screening prevented 4.3\% of expected active {TB} cases in the highest risk cohort (50\% {TB-infected}, 10\% human immunodeficiency virus [{HIV]} seroprevalence), and 8.0\% in the lowest risk cohort (5\% {TB-infected}, 1\% {HIV} seroprevalence). Tuberculin skin testing further reduced the expected incidence 8.0\% and 4.0\%, respectively. Compared with no screening, radiographic screening cost \$3,943 Canadian per active {TB} case prevented in the highest risk cohort, and \$236,496 per case prevented in the lowest risk group. Compared with radiographic screening, mass tuberculin skin testing cost \$32,601 per additional case prevented in the highest risk group, and \$68,799 per additional case prevented in the lowest risk group. Chest radiographic screening of young immigrants from countries with a high prevalence of {TB} is a relatively inexpensive means of {TB} prevention. Tuberculin skin testing is considerably less cost-effective. For immigrants from low-prevalence countries, both interventions are extremely costly with negligible impact. The cost-effectiveness of either strategy would be greatly enhanced by increased adherence to chemoprophylaxis recommendations. Radiographic screening of groups with a high prevalence of tuberculous infection will then likely save money.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

The National Healthcare Safety Network ({NHSN)} has provided simple risk adjustment of surgical site infection ({SSI)} rates to participating hospitals to facilitate quality improvement activities; improved risk models were developed and evaluated.


{METHODS}

Data reported to the {NHSN} for all operative procedures performed from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2008, were analyzed. Only {SSIs} related to the primary incision site were included. A common set of patient- and hospital-specific variables were evaluated as potential {SSI} risk factors by univariate analysis. Some ific variables were available for inclusion. Stepwise logistic regression was used to develop the specific risk models by procedure category. Bootstrap resampling was used to validate the models, and the c-index was used to compare the predictive power of new procedure-specific risk models with that of the models with the {NHSN} risk index as the only variable ({NHSN} risk index model).


{RESULTS}

From January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2008, 847 hospitals in 43 states reported a total of 849,659 procedures and 16,147 primary incisional {SSIs} (risk, 1.90\%) among 39 operative procedure categories. Overall, the median c-index of the new procedure-specific risk was greater (0.67 [range, 0.59-0.85]) than the median c-index of the {NHSN} risk index models (0.60 [range, 0.51-0.77]); for 33 of 39 procedures, the new procedure-specific models yielded a higher c-index than did the {NHSN} risk index models.


{CONCLUSIONS}

A set of new risk models developed using existing data elements collected through the {NHSN} improves predictive performance, compared with the traditional {NHSN} risk index stratification.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}

To determine whether the experience of the physician (as measured by postgraduate training level or time during the academic year) who performs the initial evaluation affects the triage of patients with acute chest pain.


{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS}

Prospective data on the presenting clinical features, initial triage, final diagnosis, and complications were collected for 7,857 patients who presented to the emergency rooms of three teaching hospitals, including 1,118 (14\%) with acute myocardial infarction ({AMI)}, 2,477 (32\%) with acute ischemic heart disease ({AIHD)} (i.e., {AMI} or unstable angina), and 335 (4\%) with major complications. The experience of the evaluating physicians, who were in their first three postgraduate years in 93\% of cases, was measured in three ways: (1) postgraduate training level, (2) month during the academic year, and (3) number of patients with acute chest pain previously evaluated. Multivariate logistic regression analyses that adjusted for hospital site and 20 clinical variables estimated the odds ratios for admission to the coronary care unit ({CCU)} and hospital associated with each incremental increase in physician experience.


{RESULTS}

With more experience (as measured by postgraduate training level or time during the academic year), the sensitivity of physicians for admitting patients with {AMI}, {AIHD}, or major complications to the hospital increased. For example, each incremental increase in postgraduate training level carried a 1.4 increase in the adjusted odds ratio for admission of a patient with {AIHD} to the hospital (p less than 0.05), corresponding to an increase in the probability of admission from 93\% to 97\%. However, increasing physician experience was also associated with an elevated false-positive rate in admitting patients without these diagnoses to the {CCU} and hospital. Thus, each incremental increase in postgraduate training level carried a 1.2 increase in the adjusted odds ratio for admission of a patient without {AIHD} to the {CCU} and hospital (p less than 0.005), corresponding to an increase in the probability of admission from 34\% to 47\%. By receiver operating characteristic curve ({ROC)} regression analyses, these changes in triage patterns were consistent with movement along a single {ROC} curve, rather than a shift to a new or better {ROC} curve.


{CONCLUSIONS}

As the experience of the physician who performed the initial evaluation increased, there was a lower threshold for admitting all patients with and without {AMI}, {AIHD}, or major complications to the {CCU} and hospital without a detectable improvement in diagnostic accuracy.},

My proposal minimizes the log partial likelihood subject to the sum of the absolute values of the parameters being bounded by a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint, it shrinks coefficients and produces some coefficients that are exactly zero. As a result it reduces the estimation variance while providing an interpretable final model. The method is a variation of the 'lasso' proposal of Tibshirani, designed for the linear regression context. Simulations indicate that the lasso can be more accurate than stepwise selection in this setting.},

The data indicate that reductions in length of stay are offset by the rising number of admissions. An examination of multiple stays--a major factor in the number of discharges--shows that States with high rates of discharges have high percentages of patients with multiple stays. Furthermore, in these States the percentage of multiple stays is high, no matter what the diagnosis. In other States, the rate is low for all diagnoses. These findings suggest that options exist for the provision of care for the same or similar conditions and that geographic patterns appear in the use of those options. An urgent need exists for research to establish the variables affecting utilization and to explore ways of changing some of the patterns of delivering services.},

We sought to systematically combine the evidence on efficacy of disease management programs ({DMPs)} in the treatment of congestive heart failure ({CHF)}, to identify and explain heterogeneity of results from prior studies of {DMPs}, and to assess potential publication bias from these studies.


{METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}

We conducted a systematic literature search on randomized clinical trials investigating the effect of {DMPs} on {CHF} outcomes and performed meta-analyses and meta-regressions comparing {DMPs} and standard care for mortality and rehospitalization. We included 36 studies from 13 different countries (with data from 8341 patients). Our meta-analysis yielded a pooled risk difference of 3\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI]} 1-6\%, P {\textless} .01) for mortality and of 8\% (95\% {CI} 5-11\%, P {\textless} .0001) for rehospitalization, both favoring {DMP.} Factors explaining heterogeneity between studies included severity of disease, proportion of beta-blocker at baseline, country, duration of follow-up, and mode of postdischarge contact. No statistically significant publication bias was detected.


{CONCLUSION}

{DMPs} have the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality for patients with {CHF.} The benefit of the intervention depends on age, severity of disease, guideline-based treatment at baseline, and {DMP} modalities. Future studies should directly compare the effect of different aspects of disease management programs for different populations.},

	abstract = {Client satisfaction is considered an important outcome measure in a managed care environment faced with escalating health care costs, shortened lengths of hospital stay, and competition among acute care hospitals. With shortened lengths of stay in acute care hospitals, discharge planning has assumed increased importance, particularly for elders who have chronic conditions, such as heart failure, that require follow-up care. Consequently, understanding the predictors of client satisfaction with discharge planning can help hospitals and their nursing staff to tailor services to meet client needs. Previous studies have focused on patient satisfaction with hospital care, with little attention given specifically to satisfaction with discharge planning and to family caregiver satisfaction with discharge planning. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a difference between elder and family member satisfaction with discharge planning 2 weeks after hospitalization and what factors predict satisfaction with discharge planning 2 weeks after hospitalization for elders hospitalized with heart failure and their family caregivers. Telephone interviews were conducted with 134 elder/family caregiver dyads 2 weeks after hospitalization. The results indicated that there were no statistically significant differences in discharge planning satisfaction of elders and their family caregivers. Continuity of care and extent to which they felt prepared to manage care following hospitalization were the best predictors of elder's and family caregiver's satisfaction with discharge planning.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Surgical site infection ({SSI)} after coronary artery bypass graft ({CABG)} surgery is an increasing healthcare problem. Investigators from Australia proposed a new, 3-point scale that assesses {SSI} risk on the basis of diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and body mass index.


{OBJECTIVE}

To validate the Australian Clinical Risk Index among patients undergoing {CABG} surgery in the United States.


{DESIGN} {AND} {SETTING}

Nested case-control study involving patients undergoing {CABG} surgery at 9 hospitals during 1991-2002.


{PATIENTS}

Case patients were those who developed {SSIs} after {CABG} surgery. Control subjects were matched to case patients on the basis of hospital, age, and procedure date.


{METHODS}

Odds ratios ({ORs)} for {SSIs} were calculated for the comparison of case patients with control subjects for all risk categories determined using the Australian Clinical Risk Index and National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System ({NNIS)} risk index. An adjusted area under the curve was used to compare predictive values among risk indices.


{RESULTS}

Four hundred sixty patients were studied, including 269 patients with {SSI} and 191 control subjects. {NNIS} risk group 2 was associated with increased rate of {SSI} ({OR}, 1.79; 95\% confidence interval [{CI]}, 1.19-2.67). No patient had an {NNIS} risk index of 3. The remaining {NNIS} categories were not predictive of infection. In contrast, an increase in Australian Clinical Risk Index was associated with an increase in risk of {SSI} (category 2: {OR}, 2.39 [95\% {CI}, 1.33-4.29]; category 3: {OR}, 4.46 [95\% {CI}, 1.83-10.85]).


{CONCLUSIONS}

The {NNIS} risk index predicts the risk of {SSI} associated with many procedures, but it has limited use in predicting the risk of {SSI} after {CABG} surgery. The new Australian Clinical Risk Index stratified patients into discrete groups associated with increased risk of {SSI.} Data from our study support the use of this new risk index in the {US} population.},

{OBJECTIVES:} To describe the methods of pooling data that investigators considered, and to detail the strengths and limitations of the chosen method: a propensity score ({PS)-based} approach that allowed for full multivariate adjustment without compromising patient privacy.
{RESEARCH} {DESIGN:} The project had a central data coordinating center responsible for collection and analysis of data. Private data could not be transmitted to the data coordinating center. Investigators assessed 4 methods for pooled analyses: full covariate sharing, cell-aggregated sharing, meta-analysis, and the {PS-based} method. We evaluated each method for protection of private information, analytic integrity and flexibility, and ability to meet the study's operational and statistical needs.
{RESULTS:} Analysis of 4 example datasets yielded substantially similar estimates if data were pooled with a {PS} versus individual covariates (0\%-3\% difference in point estimates). Several practical challenges arose. (1) {PSs} are best suited for dichotomous exposures but 6 or more exposure categories were desired; we chose a series of exposure contrasts with a common referent group. (2) Subgroup analyses had to be specified a priori. (3) Time-varying exposures and confounders required appropriate analytic handling including re-estimation of {PSs.} (4) Detection of heterogeneity among centers was necessary.
{CONCLUSIONS:} The {PS-based} pooling method offered strong protection of patient privacy and a reasonable balance between analytic integrity and flexibility of study execution. We would recommend its use in other studies that require pooling of databases, multivariate adjustment, and privacy protection.},

Readmission after hospitalization for heart failure is common. Early outpatient follow-up after hospitalization has been proposed as a means of reducing readmission rates. However, there are limited data describing patterns of follow-up after heart failure hospitalization and its association with readmission rates.


{OBJECTIVE}

To examine associations between outpatient follow-up within 7 days after discharge from a heart failure hospitalization and readmission within 30 days.


{DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PATIENTS}

Observational analysis of patients 65 years or older with heart failure and discharged to home from hospitals participating in the Organized Program to Initiate Lifesaving Treatment in Hospitalized Patients With Heart Failure and the Get With the Guidelines-Heart Failure quality improvement program from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2006.


{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURE}

All-cause readmission within 30 days after discharge.


{RESULTS}

The study population included 30,136 patients from 225 hospitals. Median length of stay was 4 days (interquartile range, 2-6) and 21.3\% of patients were readmitted within 30 days. At the hospital level, the median percentage of patients who had early follow-up after discharge from the index hospitalization was 38.3\% (interquartile range, 32.4\%-44.5\%). Compared with patients whose index admission was in a hospital in the lowest quartile of early follow-up (30-day readmission rate, 23.3\%), the rates of 30-day readmission were 20.5\% among patients in the second quartile (risk-adjusted hazard ratio [{HR]}, 0.85; 95\% confidence interval [{CI]}, 0.78-0.93), 20.5\% among patients in the third quartile (risk-adjusted {HR}, 0.87; 95\% {CI}, 0.78-0.96), and 20.9\% among patients in the fourth quartile (risk-adjusted {HR}, 0.91; 95\% {CI}, 0.83-1.00).


{CONCLUSIONS}

Among patients who are hospitalized for heart failure, substantial variation exists in hospital-level rates of early outpatient follow-up after discharge. Patients who are discharged from hospitals that have higher early follow-up rates have a lower risk of 30-day readmission.

A total of 4,633 (93\%) of the 4,987 patients who underwent {CABG} surgery during this period were matched in the 2 systems databases. There were 286 {SSIs} and 62 deep or organ space sternal {SSIs} (deep or organ space sternal {SSI} rate, 1.33\%). Univariate analysis revealed that diabetes mellitus, body mass index ({BMI)} greater than 35, and receipt of blood transfusion were risk factors for all types of {SSI} complicating {CABG} surgery. Six multivariate analysis models were created to examine either preoperative factors alone or preoperative factors combined with operative factors. All models revealed diabetes and {BMI} of 30 or greater as risk factors for {SSI} complicating {CABG} surgery. A new preoperative scoring system was devised to predict sternal {SSI}, which assigned 1 point for diabetes, 1 point for {BMI} of 30 or greater but less than 35, and 2 points for {BMI} of 35 or greater. Each point in the scoring system represented approximately a doubling of risk of {SSI.} The new scoring system performed better than the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System ({NNIS)} risk index at predicting {SSI.}


{CONCLUSION}

A new weighted scoring system based on preoperative risk factors was created to predict sternal {SSI} risk following {CABG} surgery. The new scoring system outperformed the {NNIS} risk index. Future studies are needed to validate this scoring system.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Adults discharged from hospital on a Friday are more likely to be readmitted within 30 days than are adults discharged midweek. No study has examined readmission rates for children by day of discharge.


{OBJECTIVE}

To determine the risk of readmission within 30 days by day of discharge in the paediatric population.


{METHODS}

The Canadian Institute for Health Information provided data on children 29 days to 18 years of age who were discharged from hospitals in Ontario between January 1996 and December 2000. Two groups of children (those who were readmitted within 30 days and those who were not) were compared on demographic and clinical characteristics. Multivariable modelling was used to account for potential confounding variables: age, sex, length of hospital stay, number of diagnoses, in-hospital operative procedure, in-hospital complication and hospital admission in the previous six months.


{RESULTS}

A total of 506,035 hospitalizations (involving 334,959 children) occurred over the study period. Of these children, 3.4\% were readmitted within 30 days of discharge. In total, 3.6\% of children discharged on a Friday were readmitted within 30 days compared with 3.3\% of children discharged on a Wednesday. After adjusting for patient and hospital factors, Friday discharge was not associated with readmission within 30 days (adjusted {RR} 1.07, 95\% {CI} 0.99 to 1.15). More significant predictors of readmission included number of diagnoses, in-hospital complications and hospital admission in the six months previous to the index admission date.


{CONCLUSION}

Risk of readmission within 30 days is not significantly increased for children discharged on a Friday compared with children discharged midweek. Significant risk factors for hospital readmission are patient complexity and disease severity.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Prior studies suggest that unintended medication discrepancies that represent errors are common at the time of hospital admission. These errors are particularly worthy of attention because they are not likely to be detected by computerized physician order entry systems.


{METHODS}

We prospectively studied patients reporting the use of at least 4 regular prescription medications who were admitted to general internal medicine clinical teaching units. The primary outcome was unintended discrepancies (errors) between the physicians' admission medication orders and a comprehensive medication history obtained through interview. We also evaluated the potential seriousness of these discrepancies. All discrepancies were reviewed with the medical team to determine if they were intentional or unintentional. All unintended discrepancies were rated for their potential to cause patient harm.


{RESULTS}

After screening 523 admissions, 151 patients were enrolled based on the inclusion criteria. Eighty-one patients (53.6\%; 95\% confidence interval, 45.7\%-61.6\%) had at least 1 unintended discrepancy. The most common error (46.4\%) was omission of a regularly used medication. Most (61.4\%) of the discrepancies were judged to have no potential to cause serious harm. However, 38.6\% of the discrepancies had the potential to cause moderate to severe discomfort or clinical deterioration.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Medication errors at the time of hospital admission are common, and some have the potential to cause harm. Better methods of ensuring an accurate medication history at the time of hospital admission are needed.},

We sought to create a method to conduct pooled analyses while keeping information private and allowing for full confounder adjustment.
{METHODS:} We propose a method based on propensity score ({PS)} techniques. A set of propensity scores are computed in each data-contributing center and a {PS-adjusted} analysis is then carried out on a pooled basis. The method is demonstrated in a study of the potentially negative effects of concurrent initiation of clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors ({PPIs)} in four cohorts of patients assembled from North American claims data sources. Clinical outcomes were myocardial infarction ({MI)} hospitalization and hospitalization for revascularization procedure. Success of the method was indicated by equivalent performance of our {PS-based} method and traditional confounder adjustment. We also implemented and evaluated high-dimensional propensity scores and meta-analytic techniques.
{RESULTS:} On both a pooled and individual cohort basis, we saw substantially similar point estimates and confidence intervals for studies adjusted by covariates and from privacy-maintaining propensity scores. The pooled, adjusted {OR} for {MI} hospitalization was 1.20 (95\% confidence interval 1.03, 1.41) with individual variable adjustment and 1.16 (1.00, 1.36) with {PS} adjustment. The revascularization {OR} estimates differed by {\textless} 1\%. Meta-analysis and pooling yielded substantially similar results.
{CONCLUSIONS:} We observed little difference in point estimates when we employed standard techniques or the proposed privacy-maintaining pooling method. We would recommend the technique in instances where multi-center studies require both privacy and multivariate adjustment.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Efforts to reduce hospital readmissions have focused primarily on improving transitional care. Yet variation in readmission rates may more closely reflect variation in the underlying hospitalization rates than differences in the quality of care during and after discharge.


{METHODS}

We used national Medicare data to calculate, for each local hospital referral region ({HRR)}, the 30-day, 60-day, and 90-day readmission rates among patients discharged with congestive heart failure or pneumonia. We also calculated population-based all-cause admission rates among Medicare enrollees in each {HRR.} We examined the variation in {HRR} readmission rates that was explained by overall hospitalization rates versus differences in patients' coexisting conditions, quality of discharge planning, physician supply, and bed supply.


{RESULTS}

{HRR} readmission rates ranged from 11 to 32\% for congestive heart failure and from 8 to 27\% for pneumonia. In univariate analyses, all-cause admission rates accounted for the highest proportion of regional variation in readmission rates for congestive heart failure (28\%, 34\%, and 37\% at 30, 60, and 90 days, respectively); the next highest proportions were explained by case mix (11\%, 15\%, and 18\%) and the number of cardiologists per capita (12\%, 14\%, and 15\%). Results for pneumonia were similar, except that the number of pulmonologists per capita accounted for a lower proportion of the variation (6\%, 8\%, and 7\%, respectively). In multivariate analyses, admission rates accounted for 16 to 24\% of the variation for congestive heart failure and 11 to 20\% for pneumonia; no other factor accounted for more than 6\%.


{CONCLUSIONS}

We found a substantial association between regional rates of rehospitalization and overall admission rates. Programs directed at shared savings from lower utilization of hospital services might be more successful in reducing readmissions than programs initiated to date.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}

Weekend admissions have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of mortality compared with weekday admissions for many diagnoses. We analysed emergency department admissions within the Scottish National Health Service to investigate whether mortality is increased in case of weekend emergency department admissions.


{DESIGN}

A cohort study.


{SETTING}

Scotland National Health Service ({NHS)} emergency departments.


{PARTICIPANTS}

5 271 327 emergency department admissions between 1999 and 2009. We included all patients admitted via emergency departments recorded in the Scottish Morbidity Records ({SMR01)} in {NHS}, Scotland for whom complete demographic data were available.


{PRIMARY} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}

Death as recorded by the General Register Office ({GRO).}


{RESULTS}

There was a significantly increased probability of death associated with a weekend emergency admission compared with admission on a weekday (unadjusted {OR} 1.27, 95\% {CI} 1.26 to 1.28, p{\textless}0.0001; adjusted for year of admission, gender, age, deprivation quintile and number of comorbidities {OR} 1.42, 95\% {CI} 1.40 to 1.43, p{\textless}0.0001).


{CONCLUSIONS}

Despite a general reduction in mortality over the last 11 years, there is still a significant excess mortality associated with weekend emergency admissions. Further research should be undertaken to identify the precise mechanisms underlying this effect so that measures can be put in place to reduce patient mortality.},

	abstract = {{CONTEXT}

Comprehensive discharge planning by advanced practice nurses has demonstrated short-term reductions in readmissions of elderly patients, but the benefits of more intensive follow-up of hospitalized elders at risk for poor outcomes after discharge has not been studied.


{OBJECTIVE}

To examine the effectiveness of an advanced practice nurse-centered discharge planning and home follow-up intervention for elders at risk for hospital readmissions.


{DESIGN}

Randomized clinical trial with follow-up at 2, 6, 12, and 24 weeks after index hospital discharge.


{SETTING}

Two urban, academically affiliated hospitals in Philadelphia, Pa.


{PARTICIPANTS}

Eligible patients were 65 years or older, hospitalized between August 1992 and March 1996, and had 1 of several medical and surgical reasons for admission.


{INTERVENTION}

Intervention group patients received a comprehensive discharge planning and home follow-up protocol designed specifically for elders at risk for poor outcomes after discharge and implemented by advanced practice nurses.


{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}

Readmissions, time to first readmission, acute care visits after discharge, costs, functional status, depression, and patient satisfaction.


{RESULTS}

A total of 363 patients (186 in the control group and 177 in the intervention group) were enrolled in the study; 70\% of intervention and 74\% of control subjects completed the trial. Mean age of sample was 75 years; 50\% were men and 45\% were black. By week 24 after the index hospital discharge, control group patients were more likely than intervention group patients to be readmitted at least once (37.1 \% vs 20.3 \%; P{\textless}.001). Fewer intervention group patients had multiple readmissions (6.2\% vs 14.5\%; P = .01) and the intervention group had fewer hospital days per patient (1.53 vs 4.09 days; P{\textless}.001). Time to first readmission was increased in the intervention group (P{\textless}.001). At 24 weeks after discharge, total Medicare reimbursements for health services were about \$1.2 million in the control group vs about \$0.6 million in the intervention group (P{\textless}.001). There were no significant group differences in post-discharge acute care visits, functional status, depression, or patient satisfaction.


{CONCLUSIONS}

An advanced practice nurse-centered discharge planning and home care intervention for at-risk hospitalized elders reduced readmissions, lengthened the time between discharge and readmission, and decreased the costs of providing health care. Thus, the intervention demonstrated great potential in promoting positive outcomes for hospitalized elders at high risk for rehospitalization while reducing costs.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Emergency department visits and rehospitalization are common after hospital discharge.


{OBJECTIVE}

To test the effects of an intervention designed to minimize hospital utilization after discharge.


{DESIGN}

Randomized trial using block randomization of 6 and 8. Randomly arranged index cards were placed in opaque envelopes labeled consecutively with study numbers, and participants were assigned a study group by revealing the index card.


{SETTING}

General medical service at an urban, academic, safety-net hospital.


{PATIENTS}

749 English-speaking hospitalized adults (mean age, 49.9 years).


{INTERVENTION}

A nurse discharge advocate worked with patients during their hospital stay to arrange follow-up appointments, confirm medication reconciliation, and conduct patient education with an individualized instruction booklet that was sent to their primary care provider. A clinical pharmacist called patients 2 to 4 days after discharge to reinforce the discharge plan and review medications. Participants and providers were not blinded to treatment assignment.


{MEASUREMENTS}

Primary outcomes were emergency department visits and hospitalizations within 30 days of discharge. Secondary outcomes were self-reported preparedness for discharge and frequency of primary care providers' follow-up within 30 days of discharge. Research staff doing follow-up were blinded to study group assignment.


{RESULTS}

Participants in the intervention group (n = 370) had a lower rate of hospital utilization than those receiving usual care (n = 368) (0.314 vs. 0.451 visit per person per month; incidence rate ratio, 0.695 [95\% {CI}, 0.515 to 0.937]; P = 0.009). The intervention was most effective among participants with hospital utilization in the 6 months before index admission (P = 0.014). Adverse events were not assessed; these data were collected but are still being analyzed.


{LIMITATION}

This was a single-center study in which not all potentially eligible patients could be enrolled, and outcome assessment sometimes relied on participant report.


{CONCLUSION}

A package of discharge services reduced hospital utilization within 30 days of discharge.

	abstract = {Background: Adverse events ({AEs)} are adverse outcomes caused by medical care. Several studies have indicated that a substantial number of patients experience {AEs} before or during hospitalization. However, few data describe {AEs} after hospital discharge. We determined the incidence, severity, preventability and ameliorability of {AEs} in patients discharged from the general internal medicine service of a Canadian {hospital.Methods:} At a multisite Canadian teaching hospital, we prospectively studied patients who were consecutively discharged home or to a seniors' residence from the general internal medicine service during a 14-week interval in 2002. We used telephone interview and chart review to identify outcomes after discharge. Two physicians independently reviewed each outcome to determine if the patient experienced an {AE.} The severity, preventability and ameliorability of all {AEs} were {classified.Results:} During the study period, outcomes were determined for 328 of the 361 eligible patients, who averaged 71 years of age (interquartile range 54–81 years). After discharge, 76 of the 328 patients experienced at least 1 {AE} (overall incidence 23\%, 95\% confidence interval [{CI]} 19\%–28\%). The {AE} severity ranged from symptoms only (68\% of the {AEs)} or symptoms associated with a nonpermanent disability (25\%) to permanent disability (3\%) or death (3\%). The most common {AEs} were adverse drug events (72\%), therapeutic errors (16\%) and nosocomial infections (11\%). Of the 76 patients, 38 had an {AE} that was either preventable or ameliorable (overall incidence 12\%, 95\% {CI} {9\%–16\%).Interpretation:} Approximately one-quarter of patients in our study had an {AE} after hospital discharge, and half of the {AEs} were preventable or ameliorable.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}

To (1) describe patterns of posthospital care transitions; (2) characterize these patterns as uncomplicated or complicated; (3) identify those at greatest risk for complicated transitions.


{DATA} {SOURCES/STUDY} {SETTING}

The Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey was used to identify beneficiaries aged 65 and older who were discharged from an acute care hospital in 1997-1998.


{STUDY} {DESIGN}

Patterns of posthospital transfers were described over a 30-day time period following initial hospital discharge. Uncomplicated posthospital care patterns were defined as a sequence of transfers from higher-to lower-intensity care environments without recidivism, while complicated posthospital care patterns were defined as the opposite sequence of events. Indices were developed to identify patients at risk for complicated transitions.


{PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}

Forty-six distinct types of care patterns were observed during the 30 days following hospital discharge. Among these patterns, 444 episodes (61.2 percent) were limited to a single transfer, 130 episodes (17.9 percent) included two transfers, 62 episodes (8.5 percent) involved three transfers, and 31 episodes (4.3 percent) involved four or more transfers. Fifty-nine episodes (8.1 percent) resulted in death. Between 13.4 percent and 25.0 percent of posthospital care patterns in the 1998 sample were classified as complicated. The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.771 for a predictive index that utilized administrative data and 0.833 for an index that used a combination of administrative and self-reported data.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Posthospital care transitions are common among Medicare beneficiaries and patterns of care vary greatly. A significant number of beneficiaries experienced complicated care transitions-a finding that has important implications for both patient safety and cost-containment efforts. Patients at risk for complicated care patterns can be identified using data available at the time of hospital discharge.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

To quantify admission medication discrepancies in a tertiary-care, general pediatric population, to describe their clinical importance and associated factors, and to assess a screening approach to pharmacist involvement.


{METHODS}

A total of 272 patients were studied prospectively at hospital admission. The study pharmacist performed a medication history and compared it to physicians' admission medication orders. Discrepancies between the 2 were coded as intentional but undocumented or unintentional. Unintentional discrepancies were rated for potential to cause harm by 3 physicians. Additional data collected included patients' reason for admission and presence of chronic conditions, whether physicians used a medication reconciliation form, the characteristics of patients' home medication regimen, and the time required to perform a pharmacist history and reconciliation. Interrater reliability and associations between baseline characteristics and discrepancy rates were explored.


{RESULTS}

Eighty patients (30\%) had at least one undocumented intentional discrepancy (range, 0-7). At least one unintentional discrepancy (range, 0-9) was found in 59 patients (22\%). Of the unintentional discrepancies, 23\% had moderate and 6\% had severe potential to cause discomfort or deterioration. Ratings were similar among the 3 physicians. Characteristics associated with higher risk of clinically important discrepancies were: use of the medication reconciliation form, {\textgreater} or =4 prescription medications, and antiepileptic drug use. Logistic regression revealed that only the variable {\textgreater} or =4 medications was independently associated with clinically important discrepancies.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Admission medication errors are common in this tertiary-care, general pediatric population, and nearly a third represent potential adverse events. The use of a medication reconciliation form by physicians without pharmacist involvement does not appear to reduce errors. A cutoff of {\textgreater} or =4 prescription medications is highly sensitive for identifying patients at risk of clinically important discrepancies.},

Non-elective readmission within 90 days.


{RESULTS}

Of 1378 patients discharged, 23.3\% were readmitted. After controlling for hospital and intervention status, risk of readmission was increased if the patient had more hospitalizations and emergency room visits in the prior 6 months, higher blood urea nitrogen, lower mental health function, a diagnosis of {COPD}, and increased satisfaction with access to emergency care assessed on the index hospitalization.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Both clinical and patient-centered factors identifiable at discharge are related to non-elective readmission. These factors identify high-risk patients and provide guidance for future interventions. The relationship of patient satisfaction measures to readmission deserves further study.},

After these measures were developed, we tested the relationships among the three indexes using a sample of 300 hospitals. Actual numbers of adverse events were observed for each hospital and compared to the number predicted by the {RAMI}, {RARI}, and {RACI} models. Then each hospital was ranked on each index. Our results showed that no relationship existed between a hospital's ranking on any one of these indexes and its ranking on the other two indexes. This result provides some evidence that no measure of quality should be used by itself to represent different aspects of the quality of hospital care. Adequate overall measures of hospital quality will need to include multiple measures in order to be credible and to reflect the complexity of hospital care. The findings suggest that consumers, payers, and policymakers cannot simply choose one hospitalwide measure, such as the mortality rate, to validly represent a hospital's performance: those hospitals with high rankings on their mortality rates do not necessarily rank high on their readmission rates or complication rates.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Readmissions to hospital are common, costly and often preventable. An easy-to-use index to quantify the risk of readmission or death after discharge from hospital would help clinicians identify patients who might benefit from more intensive post-discharge care. We sought to derive and validate an index to predict the risk of death or unplanned readmission within 30 days after discharge from hospital to the community.
{METHODS:} In a prospective cohort study, 48 patient-level and admission-level variables were collected for 4812 medical and surgical patients who were discharged to the community from 11 hospitals in Ontario. We used a split-sample design to derive and validate an index to predict the risk of death or nonelective readmission within 30 days after discharge. This index was externally validated using administrative data in a random selection of 1,000,000 Ontarians discharged from hospital between 2004 and 2008.
{RESULTS:} Of the 4812 participating patients, 385 (8.0\%) died or were readmitted on an unplanned basis within 30 days after discharge. Variables independently associated with this outcome (from which we derived the mnemonic {"LACE")} included length of stay ({"L");} acuity of the admission ({"A");} comorbidity of the patient (measured with the Charlson comorbidity index score) ({"C");} and emergency department use (measured as the number of visits in the six months before admission) ({"E").} Scores using the {LACE} index ranged from 0 (2.0\% expected risk of death or urgent readmission within 30 days) to 19 (43.7\% expected risk). The {LACE} index was discriminative (C statistic 0.684) and very accurate (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic 14.1, p=0.59) at predicting outcome risk.
{INTERPRETATION:} The {LACE} index can be used to quantify risk of death or unplanned readmission within 30 days after discharge from hospital. This index can be used with both primary and administrative data. Further research is required to determine whether such quantification changes patient care or outcomes.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Readmission rates are often proposed as markers for quality of care. However, a consistent link between readmissions and quality has not been established.


{OBJECTIVE}

To test the relation of readmission to quality and the utility of readmissions as hospital quality measures.


{SUBJECTS}

One thousand, seven hundred and fifty-eight Medicare patients hospitalized in four states between 1991 to 1992 with pneumonia or congestive heart failure ({CHF).}


{DESIGN}

Case control.


{MEASURES}

Related adverse readmissions ({RARs)}, defined as readmissions that indicate potentially sub-optimal care during initial hospitalization, were identified from administrative data using readmission diagnoses and intervening time periods designated by physician panels. We used linear regression to estimate the association between implicit and explicit quality measures and readmission status ({RARs}, non-{RAR} readmissions, and nonreadmissions), adjusting for severity. We tested whether {RARs} were associated with inferior care and performed simulations to determine whether {RARs} discriminated between hospitals on the basis of quality.


{RESULTS}

Compared with nonreadmitted pneumonia patients, patients with {RARs} had lower adjusted quality measured both by explicit (0.25 standardized units, P = 0.004) and implicit methods (0.17, P = 0.047). Adjusted differences for {CHF} patients were 0.17 (P = 0.048) and 0.20 (P = 0.017), respectively. In some analyses, patients with non-{RAR} readmissions also experienced lower quality. However, rates of inferior quality care did not differ significantly by readmission status, and simulations identified no meaningful relationship between {RARs} and hospital quality of care.


{CONCLUSIONS}

{RARs} are statistically associated with lower quality of care. However, neither {RARs} nor other readmissions appear to be useful tools for identifying patients who experience inferior care or for comparing quality among hospitals.},

	abstract = {{CONTEXT}

Predicting hospital readmission risk is of great interest to identify which patients would benefit most from care transition interventions, as well as to risk-adjust readmission rates for the purposes of hospital comparison.


{OBJECTIVE}

To summarize validated readmission risk prediction models, describe their performance, and assess suitability for clinical or administrative use.


{DATA} {SOURCES} {AND} {STUDY} {SELECTION}

The databases of {MEDLINE}, {CINAHL}, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception through March 2011, the {EMBASE} database was searched through August 2011, and hand searches were performed of the retrieved reference lists. Dual review was conducted to identify studies published in the English language of prediction models tested with medical patients in both derivation and validation cohorts.


{DATA} {EXTRACTION}

Data were extracted on the population, setting, sample size, follow-up interval, readmission rate, model discrimination and calibration, type of data used, and timing of data collection.


{DATA} {SYNTHESIS}

Of 7843 citations reviewed, 30 studies of 26 unique models met the inclusion criteria. The most common outcome used was 30-day readmission; only 1 model specifically addressed preventable readmissions. Fourteen models that relied on retrospective administrative data could be potentially used to risk-adjust readmission rates for hospital comparison; of these, 9 were tested in large {US} populations and had poor discriminative ability (c statistic range: 0.55-0.65). Seven models could potentially be used to identify high-risk patients for intervention early during a hospitalization (c statistic range: 0.56-0.72), and 5 could be used at hospital discharge (c statistic range: 0.68-0.83). Six studies compared different models in the same population and 2 of these found that functional and social variables improved model discrimination. Although most models incorporated variables for medical comorbidity and use of prior medical services, few examined variables associated with overall health and function, illness severity, or social determinants of health.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Most current readmission risk prediction models that were designed for either comparative or clinical purposes perform poorly. Although in certain settings such models may prove useful, efforts to improve their performance are needed as use becomes more widespread.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}

To develop a new, simple, and practical risk index for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft ({CABG)} surgery, to develop a preoperative risk index that is predictive of surgical-site infection ({SSI)}, and to compare the new risk indices with the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance ({NNIS)} System risk index.


{DESIGN}

Potential risk factor and infection data were collected prospectively and analyzed by multivariate analysis. Two new risk indices were constructed and then compared with the {NNIS} System risk index for predictive power for {SSI.}


{SETTING}

Alfred Hospital is a 350-bed, university-affiliated, tertiary-care referral center. The cardiothoracic unit performs approximately 650 {CABG} procedures per year.


{PATIENTS}

All patients undergoing {CABG} surgery within the cardiothoracic unit at Alfred Hospital between December 1, 1996, and September 29, 2000, were included.


{RESULTS}

Potential risk factor data were complete for 2,345 patients. There were 199 {SSIs.} Obesity (odds ratio [{OR]}, 1.78; 95\% confidence interval [{CI95]}, 1.24 to 2.55), peripheral or cerebrovascular disease ({OR}, 1.64; {CI95}, 1.16 to 2.33), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus ({OR}, 2.29; {CI95}, 1.15 to 4.54), and a procedure lasting longer than 5 hours ({OR}, 1.75; {CI95}, 1.18 to 2.58) were identified as independent risk factors for {SSI.} With the use of a different combination of these risk factors, two risk indices were constructed and compared using the Goodman-Kruskal nonparametric correlation coefficient (G). kisk index B had the highest G value (0.3405; {CI95}, 0.2245 to 0.4565), compared with the {NNIS} System risk index G value (0.3142; {CI95}, 0.1462 to 0.4822). The G value for risk index A, constructed from preoperative variables only, was 0.3299 ({CI9},, 0.2039 to 0.4559).


{CONCLUSION}

Two new risk indices have been developed. Both indices are as predictive as the {NNIS} System risk index. One of the new risk indices can also be applied preoperatively.},

Data were obtained from two separate studies of acute hospital utilization in south-west England, conducted between 1992 and 1994. The appropriateness of admission was assessed using explicit standardized criteria in the form of the intensity-severity-discharge review system with adult criteria ({ISD-A).} Up to 19 explanatory variables were available for the analyses. These variables were modelled for each centre separately, using logistic regression to produce final sets of factors independently related to the appropriateness of admission. For one centre, the final model contained age/ specialty and use of community services. For the other, the final model contained two measures of health status on admission-coping failure and admission with stroke. It is concluded that the complex interplay between the characteristics of patients, referrers, alternative forms of care and the acute hospital may result in quite different types of inappropriate admissions in different locations.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

To assign responsibility for variations in small area hospitalization rates to specific hospitals and to evaluate the Roemer's Law in a way that does not artificially induce correlation between bed supply and utilization.


{DATA} {SOURCES/STUDY} {SETTING}

We used data on hospitalizations and outpatient treatment for 15 medical conditions of nonmanaged care Part B eligible Medicare enrollees of 65 years and older in Massachusetts in 2000.


{STUDY} {DESIGN}

We used a Bayesian model to estimate each hospital's pool of potential patients and the fraction of the pool hospitalized (its propensity to hospitalize, {PTH).} To evaluate the Roemer's Law, we calculated the correlation between hospitals' {PTH} and beds per potential patient. Patient severity was measured using All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups.


{RESULTS}

We show that our approach does not artificially induce a correlation between beds and utilization whereas the traditional approach does. Nevertheless, our approach indicates a strong relationship between {PTH} and beds (r=0.56). Eighteen (of 66) hospitals had a high {PTH} that differed significantly from 16 hospitals with a low {PTH.} Average patient severity in the high {PTH} hospitals was lower than in the low {PTH} hospitals. Although the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.12), there was a medium effect size (0.58).


{DISCUSSION}

Variation across hospitals in the {PTH} index, the strong relationship between beds and the {PTH}, and the lack of relationship between severity and the {PTH} suggest the importance of policies that limit bed growth of high {PTH} hospitals and create incentives for high {PTH} hospitals to reduce hospitalizations.},

Medicare spent over \$2.5 billion per year (24 per cent of Medicare inpatient expenditures) on such readmissions between 1974 and 1977. Analogous expenditures in 1984 could approach \$8 billion. Even a small decrease in the readmission rate could result in substantial savings for the Medicare program. The recently enacted prospective-payment legislation, however, creates economic incentives that could increase readmission rates. Attempts by professional review organizations or others to develop hospital readmission profiles will need to control for patient and hospital characteristics that are correlated with the likelihood of readmission. Further study of such characteristics could help identify high-risk patient groups for whom increased outpatient supports might prove cost effective.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Patients with complex care needs who require care across different health care settings are vulnerable to experiencing serious quality problems. A care transitions intervention designed to encourage patients and their caregivers to assert a more active role during care transitions may reduce rehospitalization rates.


{METHODS}

Randomized controlled trial. Between September 1, 2002, and August 31, 2003, patients were identified at the time of hospitalization and were randomized to receive the intervention or usual care. The setting was a large integrated delivery system located in Colorado. Subjects (N = 750) included community-dwelling adults 65 years or older admitted to the study hospital with 1 of 11 selected conditions. Intervention patients received (1) tools to promote cross-site communication, (2) encouragement to take a more active role in their care and to assert their preferences, and (3) continuity across settings and guidance from a "transition coach." Rates of rehospitalization were measured at 30, 90, and 180 days.


{RESULTS}

Intervention patients had lower rehospitalization rates at 30 days (8.3 vs 11.9, P = .048) and at 90 days (16.7 vs 22.5, P = .04) than control subjects. Intervention patients had lower rehospitalization rates for the same condition that precipitated the index hospitalization at 90 days (5.3 vs 9.8, P = .04) and at 180 days (8.6 vs 13.9, P = .046) than controls. The mean hospital costs were lower for intervention patients (\$2058) vs controls (\$2546) at 180 days (log-transformed P = .049).


{CONCLUSION}

Coaching chronically ill older patients and their caregivers to ensure that their needs are met during care transitions may reduce the rates of subsequent rehospitalization.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

About 1 in 5 Medicare fee-for-service patients discharged from the hospital is rehospitalized within 30 days. Beginning in 2013, hospitals with high risk-standardized readmission rates will be subject to a Medicare reimbursement penalty.


{PURPOSE}

To describe interventions evaluated in studies aimed at reducing rehospitalization within 30 days of discharge.


{DATA} {SOURCES}

{MEDLINE}, {EMBASE}, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched for reports published between January 1975 and January 2011.


{STUDY} {SELECTION}

English-language randomized, controlled trials; cohort studies; or noncontrolled before-after studies of interventions to reduce rehospitalization that reported rehospitalization rates within 30 days.


{DATA} {EXTRACTION}

2 reviewers independently identified candidate articles from the results of the initial search on the basis of title and abstract. Two 2-physician reviewer teams reviewed the full text of candidate articles to identify interventions and assess study quality.


{DATA} {SYNTHESIS}

43 articles were identified, and a taxonomy was developed to categorize interventions into 3 domains that encompassed 12 distinct activities. Predischarge interventions included patient education, medication reconciliation, discharge planning, and scheduling of a follow-up appointment before discharge. Postdischarge interventions included follow-up telephone calls, patient-activated hotlines, timely communication with ambulatory providers, timely ambulatory provider follow-up, and postdischarge home visits. Bridging interventions included transition coaches, physician continuity across the inpatient and outpatient setting, and patient-centered discharge instruction.


{LIMITATIONS}

Inadequate description of individual studies' interventions precluded meta-analysis of effects. Many studies identified in the review were single-institution assessments of quality improvement activities rather than those with experimental designs. Several common interventions have not been studied outside of multicomponent "discharge bundles."


{CONCLUSION}

No single intervention implemented alone was regularly associated with reduced risk for 30-day rehospitalization.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

National attention has increasingly focused on readmission as a target for quality improvement. We present the development and validation of a model approved by the National Quality Forum and used by the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services for hospital-level public reporting of risk-standardized readmission rates for patients discharged from the hospital after an acute myocardial infarction.


{METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}

We developed a hierarchical logistic regression model to calculate hospital risk-standardized 30-day all-cause readmission rates for patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction. The model was derived using Medicare claims data for a 2006 cohort and validated using claims and medical record data. The unadjusted readmission rate was 18.9\%. The final model included 31 variables and had discrimination ranging from 8\% observed 30-day readmission rate in the lowest predictive decile to 32\% in the highest decile and a C statistic of 0.63. The 25th and 75th percentiles of the risk-standardized readmission rates across 3890 hospitals were 18.6\% and 19.1\%, with fifth and 95th percentiles of 18.0\% and 19.9\%, respectively. The odds of all-cause readmission for a hospital 1 {SD} above average were 1.35 times that of a hospital 1 {SD} below average. Hospital-level adjusted readmission rates developed using the claims model were similar to rates produced for the same cohort using a medical record model (correlation, 0.98; median difference, 0.02 percentage points).


{CONCLUSIONS}

This claims-based model of hospital risk-standardized readmission rates for patients with acute myocardial infarction produces estimates that are excellent surrogates for those produced from a medical record model.},

	doi = {10.1097/01.mlr.0000228002.43688.c2},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

The hospital readmission rate has been proposed as an important outcome indicator computable from routine statistics. However, most commonly used measures raise conceptual issues.


{OBJECTIVES}

We sought to evaluate the usefulness of the computerized algorithm for identifying avoidable readmissions on the basis of minimum bias, criterion validity, and measurement precision.


{RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {SUBJECTS}

A total of 131,809 hospitalizations of patients discharged alive from 49 hospitals were used to compare the predictive performance of risk adjustment methods. A subset of a random sample of 570 medical records of discharge/readmission pairs in 12 hospitals were reviewed to estimate the predictive value of the screening of potentially avoidable readmissions.


{MEASURES}

Potentially avoidable readmissions, defined as readmissions related to a condition of the previous hospitalization and not expected as part of a program of care and occurring within 30 days after the previous discharge, were identified by a computerized algorithm. Unavoidable readmissions were considered as censored events.


{RESULTS}

A total of 5.2\% of hospitalizations were followed by a potentially avoidable readmission, 17\% of them in a different hospital. The predictive value of the screen was 78\%; 27\% of screened readmissions were judged clearly avoidable. The correlation between the hospital rate of clearly avoidable readmission and all readmissions rate, potentially avoidable readmissions rate or the ratio of observed to expected readmissions were respectively 0.42, 0.56 and 0.66. Adjustment models using clinical information performed better.


{CONCLUSION}

Adjusted rates of potentially avoidable readmissions are scientifically sound enough to warrant their inclusion in hospital quality surveillance.},

Diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia by bacteriologic analysis of bronchoscopic and nonbronchoscopic "blind" bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991;143: 1121-1129) was used as operational criteria for decision-making regarding antibiotic therapy. Patients with {CPIS} {\textless}/= 6 (implying low likelihood of pneumonia) were randomized to receive either standard therapy (choice and duration of antibiotics at the discretion of physicians) or ciprofloxacin monotherapy with reevaluation at 3 d; ciprofloxacin was discontinued if {CPIS} remained {\textless}/= 6 at 3 d. Antibiotics were continued beyond 3 d in 90\% (38 of 42) of the patients in the standard as therapy compared with 28\% (11 of 39) in the experimental therapy group (p = 0.0001). In patients in whom {CPIS} remained {\textless}/= 6 at the 3 d evaluation point, antibiotics were still continued in 96\% (24 of 25) in the standard therapy group but in 0\% (0 of 25) of the patients in the experimental therapy group (p = 0.0001). Mortality and length of {ICU} stay did not differ despite a shorter duration (p = 0.0001) and lower cost (p = 0.003) of antimicrobial therapy in the experimental as compared with the standard therapy arm. Antimicrobial resistance, or superinfections, or both, developed in 15\% (5 of 37) of the patients in the experimental versus 35\% (14 of 37) of the patients in the standard therapy group (p = 0.017). Thus, overtreatment with antibiotics is widely prevalent, but unnecessary in most patients with pulmonary infiltrates in the {ICU.} The operational criteria used, regardless of the precise definition of pneumonia, accurately identified patients with pulmonary infiltrates for whom monotherapy with a short course of antibiotics was appropriate.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

To study the effects of a management programme on hospitalisation and health care costs one year after admission for heart failure.


{DESIGN}

Prospective, randomised trial.


{SETTING}

University hospital with a primary catchment area of 250,000 inhabitants.


{PATIENTS}

190 patients (aged 65-84 years, 52.3\% men) hospitalised because of heart failure.


{INTERVENTION}

Two types of patient management were compared. The intervention group received education on heart failure and self management, with follow up at an easy access, nurse directed outpatient clinic for one year after discharge. The control group was managed according to routine clinical practice.


{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}

Time to readmission, days in hospital, and health care costs during one year.


{RESULTS}

The one year survival rate was 71.8\% (n = 79) in the control group and 70.0\% (n = 56) in the intervention group ({NS).} The mean time to readmission was longer in the intervention group than in the control group (141 (87) v 106 (101); p {\textless} 0.05) and number of days in hospital tended to be fewer (4.2 (7.8) v 8.2 (14.3); p = 0.07). There was a trend towards a mean annual reduction in health care costs per patient of {US\$1300} ({US} \$1 = {SEK} 7.76) in the intervention group compared with costs in the controls ({US\$3594} v 2294; p = 0.07).

The authors sought to determine which hypothesis is more likely to explain the high frequency of matched isolates among Haitian-born tuberculosis patients in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The authors determined the number of different bacterial genotypes in this community as compared with other foreign-born tuberculosis patients and applied a recently described measure of genetic similarity between M. tuberculosis organisms ("genetic distance"). Among 76 Haitian-born tuberculosis patients diagnosed during 1996-1998, the authors identified 47 distinct genotypes on the basis of standard {IS6110} {DNA} typing and categorical analysis. In genetic distance analysis, these 47 genotypes showed as great a genetic diversity as that observed among the 191 distinct genotypes identified in 216 other foreign-born tuberculosis patients.

Urgent, unplanned hospital readmissions are increasingly being used to gauge the quality of care. We reviewed urgent readmissions to determine which were potentially avoidable and compared rates of all-cause and avoidable readmissions.


{METHODS}

In a multicentre, prospective cohort study, we reviewed all urgent readmissions that occurred within six months among patients discharged to the community from 11 teaching and community hospitals between October 2002 and July 2006. Summaries of the readmissions were reviewed by at least four practising physicians using standardized methods to judge whether the readmission was an adverse event (poor clinical outcome due to medical care) and whether the adverse event could have been avoided. We used a latent class model to determine whether the probability that each readmission was truly avoidable exceeded 50\%.


{RESULTS}

Of the 4812 patients included in the study, 649 (13.5\%, 95\% confidence interval [{CI]} 12.5\%-14.5\%) had an urgent readmission within six months after discharge. We considered 104 of them (16.0\% of those readmitted, 95\% {CI} 13.3\%-19.1\%; 2.2\% of those discharged, 95\% {CI} 1.8\%-2.6\%) to have had a potentially avoidable readmission. The proportion of patients who had an urgent readmission varied significantly by hospital (range 7.5\%-22.5\%; χ(2) = 92.9, p {\textless} 0.001); the proportion of readmissions deemed avoidable did not show significant variation by hospital (range 1.2\%-3.7\%; χ(2) = 12.5, p {\textless} 0.25). We found no association between the proportion of patients who had an urgent readmission and the proportion of patients who had an avoidable readmission (Pearson correlation 0.294; p = 0.38). In addition, we found no association between hospital rankings by proportion of patients readmitted and rankings by proportion of patients with an avoidable readmission (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.28, p = 0.41).


{INTERPRETATION}

Urgent readmissions deemed potentially avoidable were relatively uncommon, comprising less than 20\% of all urgent readmissions following hospital discharge. Hospital-specific proportions of patients who were readmitted were not related to proportions with a potentially avoidable readmission.},

The study question is good, is the proportion of avoidable readmissions related to readmissions? If it is, then readmissions are a good proxy for avoidable readmissions, which are a good proxy for quality of care.
He follows a cohort in Ottawa of 4812 over 11 hospitals. 600 get readmitted in six months (which itself is suspiciously low). He gets four physicians to classify them as avoidable and resolves disagreement using some latent class analysis. 102 are avoidable.
He then looks at the proportion readmitted, and ranks. Then he looks at the proportion avoidably readmitted, and ranks. He uses Spearman's to correlate, and finds no evidence for correlation.
Critically, he did not adjust the readmission rates for patient risk. So he is just relating crude readmission risk, which nobody claims is a good proxy for avoidable readmission risk. I see why he didn't; there would be not enough power.
Indeed with only 6 - 12 avoidable cases per hospital, the proportion could be strongly swayed by a few cases. Furthermore, since the rankings were close, then the ranking could be very strongly affected by slight sampling error. I could probably show this conclusively, but I think it is rather obvious.
I should try and be polite about it though.

	abstract = {{RATIONALE}

Some clusters of patients who have Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates with identical {DNA} fingerprint patterns grow faster than others. It is unclear what predictors determine cluster growth.


{OBJECTIVES}

To assess whether the development of a tuberculosis ({TB)} outbreak can be predicted by the characteristics of its first two patients.


{METHODS}

Demographic and clinical data of all culture-confirmed patients with {TB} in the Netherlands from 1993 through 2004 were combined with {DNA} fingerprint data. Clusters were restricted to cluster episodes of 2 years to only detect newly arising clusters. Characteristics of the first two patients were compared between small (2-4 cases) and large (5 or more cases) cluster episodes. Measurements and Main Results: Of 5,454 clustered cases, 1,756 (32\%) were part of a cluster episode of 2 years. Of 622 cluster episodes, 54 (9\%) were large and 568 (91\%) were small episodes. Independent predictors for large cluster episodes were as follows: less than 3 months' time between the diagnosis of the first two patients, one or both patients were young ({\textless}35 yr), both patients lived in an urban area, and both patients came from sub-Saharan Africa.


{CONCLUSIONS}

In the Netherlands, patients in new cluster episodes should be screened for these risk factors. When the risk pattern applies, targeted interventions (e.g., intensified contact investigation) should be considered to prevent further cluster expansion.},
